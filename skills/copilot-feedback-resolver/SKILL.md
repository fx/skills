# Copilot Feedback Resolver

> **Path note:** `[SKILLS_DIR]` below is the directory holding this skill's own folder —
> the parent of the directory containing this `SKILL.md`. Substitute its absolute path;
> every skill referenced below is installed as a sibling there.

**⛔ Load `review-rules` first** (Skill tool: `skill="review-rules"`). It is the
canonical review procedure. This skill is the **Copilot thread adapter**: the
GraphQL calls that fetch, reply to and resolve Copilot's review threads, and the
category table that maps a Copilot comment onto a disposition. Where the two
appear to disagree, `review-rules` wins.

From `review-rules`, and not restated here:

- **Step 1** — the Scope Brief. If a coordinator handed you one, it is binding. If
  this skill was invoked directly, reconstruct one before you can run the scope
  filter at all, and say that you did.
- **Steps 2–3** — triage in filter order, and verify the premise before acting.
- **Step 4** — sweep the class before pushing. Copilot comments on the site it
  read, and every push costs a full Copilot wait cycle, so a half-closed class
  spends one of those per sibling.
- **Step 5** — what each disposition means, and that a coordinator's disposition
  is authoritative.
- **Step 6** — the `REVIEW.md` entry for an incorrect finding, its 4000-character
  constraint, and the rule against writing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or
  running `setup` from here.

## ⛔ PR Comments Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**NEVER leave new comments directly on GitHub PRs.** Forbidden: `gh pr review
--comment`, `gh pr comment`, any GraphQL mutation creating a new review or
PR-level comment, and **any response to a human reviewer's thread**.

**This skill ONLY processes GitHub Copilot threads.** Permitted operations are
exactly two: reply to an existing Copilot thread with
`addPullRequestReviewThreadReply`, and resolve it with `resolveReviewThread`.

## ⚠️ Resolving the thread IS the deliverable

**Addressing feedback without resolving the thread is INCOMPLETE WORK.** After
handling any Copilot feedback you MUST push the code changes (where the
disposition called for a change), resolve **each** thread via the mutation below,
and verify by re-querying the PR. Code changes alone are insufficient.

Copilot reads `REVIEW.md` from the **head branch**, so a rule you add there takes
effect on this same PR's next review.

## Prerequisites

**CRITICAL: Load the `github` skill FIRST** before running any GitHub API operations. This skill provides essential patterns and error handling for `gh` CLI commands.

## INVOCATION BOUNDARY

Use this resolver only when the user explicitly names or invokes it, or when an active explicitly invoked workflow calls `copilot-feedback-resolver` by name. A standalone mention of Copilot, a PR, comments, review state, or failing checks does not auto-load it.

**Invocation:** always with the brief and your dispositions, never bare —

```
Skill tool: skill="copilot-feedback-resolver",
            args="<Scope Brief verbatim> — dispositions: <thread id> blocking, <thread id> immaterial, <thread id> deferred (<exclusion>) — false premise (this skill's own handler): <thread id> (<what does not hold>)"
```

## Processing Rules

**ONLY process UNRESOLVED comments. NEVER touch, modify, or re-process already resolved comments. Skip them entirely.**

## Core Workflow

### 1. Fetch Unresolved Copilot Threads

Query review threads using GraphQL.

**IMPORTANT:** Use inline values, NOT `$variable` syntax. The `$` character causes shell escaping issues.

```bash
# Replace OWNER, REPO, PR_NUMBER with actual values
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              author { login }
              body
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

**Filter for:** `isResolved: false` AND author is Copilot (github-actions bot or copilot signature)

### 2. Categorize Each Comment

Triage per `review-rules` Steps 2–3. This table is the Copilot-specific mapping
from what a comment looks like onto the disposition that triage produces — it is
not a shortcut around the filters.

**A coordinator's disposition wins over this table**, which classifies from
comment text alone (`review-rules` Step 5). Use the table only for threads it did
not cover, and for a standalone run.
| Category | Indicator | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Nitpick** | Contains `[nitpick]` prefix **and reaches filter 3 and fails it** — in scope, violating no rule, and immaterial. An out-of-scope one exits at filter 1 and is **Deferred**, not this row | Reply with the materiality reasoning and resolve, without editing |
| **Outdated** | Refers to code that no longer exists | Reply with the explanation, resolve |
| **Incorrect** | Misreads a deliberate project convention | Reply with the explanation, resolve, record it in `REVIEW.md` |
| **Valid — blocking** | **Is blocking** per `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking — which includes a contract blocker, and those never pass through the bar at all. Do not narrow it here | Delegate to coder sub-agent to fix |
| **Valid — immaterial** | Correct, but would change nothing if it shipped uncorrected | Reply with that reasoning, resolve. **Do not edit** |
| **Deferred** | Valid but out of scope for this PR | Reply citing the exclusion, resolve. **No edit and no commit** — return the follow-up to the coordinator |

The `[nitpick]` prefix is Copilot's own label, never a verdict: a project-rule,
security, privacy or correctness defect carrying it is still blocking. Never
auto-resolve on the prefix alone.

### 3. Resolve Threads

Use GraphQL mutation to resolve.

**IMPORTANT:** Use inline values, NOT `$variable` syntax.

```bash
# Replace THREAD_ID with actual thread ID (e.g., PRRT_kwDONZ...)
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_ID"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

### 4. Reply to a Thread

**CRITICAL: reply to the Copilot review thread, NOT to the PR.** Use inline
values, NOT `$variable` syntax.

```bash
# Replace THREAD_ID and message with actual values
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "PRRT_xxx",
    body: "Your explanation here"
  }) {
    comment { id }
  }
}'
```

**⛔ FORBIDDEN — never use:** `gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment`,
`gh pr comment`, or any interaction with a human reviewer's thread.

Every disposition ends with a reply and a resolve; what differs is only the reply
and whether anything was changed (`review-rules` Step 5). Phrasing that works:

- **Nitpick / immaterial** — what the observation is, and why it is below the bar.
  The reply is required, not an optional acknowledgment: a silently closed thread
  leaves no record of why no edit was made.
- **Outdated** — "This comment refers to code refactored in commit abc123. The
  issue is no longer applicable."
- **Incorrect** — "This conflicts with our [convention name] convention. [Brief
  explanation]. Documented in REVIEW.md so future reviews pick it up." The
  `REVIEW.md` entry is required work (`review-rules` Step 6), and Copilot reads
  that file from the head branch, so it takes effect on this PR's next review.
- **Blocking** — delegate to a coder sub-agent with the PR number and title, the
  file and line, the comment text, and the thread ID for resolution after the fix.
  Ensure it pushes and then resolves.
- **Deferred** — "Valid suggestion, but out of scope for this PR: <the exclusion
  that covers it>. Returned to the coordinator as a follow-up rather than tracked
  here, so this PR is not widened."

**Never defer without recording it somewhere durable — and that record must not be
a commit on this PR.** Return it to the coordinator for the finding ledger or the
PR description; running standalone in a repo that tracks follow-ups in
`PROJECT.md`, propose the entry to the user instead of committing it. A bare
"acknowledged for follow-up" recorded nowhere is INCOMPLETE WORK; a `PROJECT.md`
commit here is a widened change.

### 5. Verify Completion

1. **Push any changes:** `git push`
2. Re-query PR to confirm ALL Copilot threads resolved
3. Report summary of actions taken

## Success Criteria

**Task is INCOMPLETE until ALL of these are done:**

1. ✅ All code changes pushed to the PR branch
2. ✅ **EVERY addressed thread resolved via GraphQL mutation** (not just code fixed!)
3. ✅ **For INCORRECT feedback: `REVIEW.md` updated** to prevent recurrence
4. ✅ **For DEFERRED feedback: the follow-up is recorded outside this PR** — returned to the coordinator, or proposed to the user when running standalone. **No `PROJECT.md` commit on this branch**
5. ✅ Re-query confirms `isResolved: true` for all processed threads
6. ✅ Output summary table (see format below)

### Required Output: Thread Summary Table

**You MUST output this table after processing all threads:**

```
| Thread ID | File:Line | Category | Action Taken | Status |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| PRRT_xxx  | src/foo.ts:42 | Nitpick | Replied with reasoning, no edit | ✅ Resolved |
| PRRT_yyy  | src/bar.ts:15 | Valid | Fixed null check | ✅ Resolved |
| PRRT_zzz  | lib/util.js:8 | Outdated | Code refactored | ✅ Resolved |
| PRRT_aaa  | src/ui.tsx:20 | Deferred | Returned to coordinator, no edit | ✅ Resolved |
```

**Column definitions:**
- **Thread ID**: GraphQL thread ID (truncated for readability)
- **File:Line**: Location of the comment
- **Category**: Nitpick, Valid, Outdated, Incorrect, or Deferred
- **Action Taken**: Brief description of resolution (10 words max)
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved, ❌ Failed, or ⏳ Pending

**Common failure mode:** Fixing code but forgetting to resolve the threads. This leaves the PR with unresolved conversations even though the issues are fixed. ALWAYS run the resolution mutation after pushing code.

## Error Handling

- API failures: Retry with proper auth
- Thread ID issues: Use alternative queries
- Delegation failures: Attempt simple fixes directly
- Partial resolution is better than none
