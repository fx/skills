# wait-for-copilot-review.sh
# Waits until GitHub Copilot has submitted a review of the PR's CURRENT head commit.
#
# Usage: ./wait-for-copilot-review.sh <PR_NUMBER> [TIMEOUT_SECONDS]
# Default timeout: 900 seconds (15 minutes), uniform across the wait scripts in this catalog.
#     Sized to cover the worst observed Copilot delivery time (12 m 42 s) in ONE run,
#     which is what retires the old "re-run up to 3 times" protocol.
# Env: COPILOT_WAIT_DEBUG=1  echo the raw review-request POST response
#
# ⛔ RUN THIS IN THE BACKGROUND (`run_in_background: true`), redirecting stdout and
#    stderr to a log file. The Bash tool caps a FOREGROUND `timeout` at 600 000 ms,
#    which is BELOW this script's budget — a foreground call is guaranteed to be
#    killed mid-poll, printing no STATUS and no exit code. That kill is exactly what
#    made the old re-run protocol unreachable. Backgrounded processes are not
#    subject to that cap, which is why the budget can now exceed it.
#
# The timeout is measured against the WALL CLOCK (bash `SECONDS`), not against
# accumulated `sleep` time. Each poll also spends 2+ network round-trips, so
# counting only sleeps understated real elapsed time by 40-110 s over a full run.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# STATUS PROTOCOL (shared by every wait script in this catalog)
#
# The LAST line of stdout is always `STATUS=<state>`, and the exit code mirrors it.
# Read the STATUS line; it is the primary signal.
#
#   STATUS=TERMINAL_PASS   exit 0  A review covers the current head AND no Copilot
#                                  thread is unresolved.
#   STATUS=TERMINAL_FAIL   exit 1  A review covers the current head and Copilot
#                                  threads remain open (or the thread count could
#                                  not be read, which is not a zero). Settled —
#                                  triage the threads; do not re-run for a better
#                                  answer.
#   STATUS=PENDING         exit 2  No review of the current head arrived within the
#                                  budget. NOT a failure and NOT evidence anything
#                                  is wrong: observed delivery ranges from 85 s to
#                                  12 m 42 s, and the ruleset that auto-requests a
#                                  review fires on some pushes and not others.
#                                  Re-running is safe and is the correct response.
#                                  NEVER grounds to conclude the code is clean.
#   STATUS=NOT_CONFIGURED  exit 3  NEVER RETURNED by this script. Whether Copilot is
#                                  "configured" has no answerable form — the only
#                                  signal that would express it, `requested_reviewers`,
#                                  does not work at all (D1/D3). Callers MUST NOT
#                                  branch on it here, and MUST NOT reinstate any
#                                  "request again, then re-run" recovery keyed to it.
#   STATUS=ERROR           exit 4  Bad arguments, `gh` too old, repo or PR head
#                                  unresolvable. The wait never started.
#
# On a settled review, stdout also carries machine-readable
#     REVIEWED_COMMIT_ID=<sha>
#     PR_HEAD_SHA=<sha>
#     SUPPRESSED_COMMENTS=1|0|unknown
#     UNRESOLVED_THREADS=<n|unknown>
# so the caller can re-verify the match itself rather than trusting this script's
# word for it. The SHA pair is the line that gates: a review of a superseded commit
# is not coverage. `SUPPRESSED_COMMENTS` is INFORMATIONAL ONLY (D4): `1` means a
# `Suppressed comments` block is present, `0` means the fetch succeeded and found
# none, `unknown` means the fetch FAILED so this script cannot say (D5). None of the
# three withholds the gate, and a caller should not re-run merely to turn `unknown`
# into a number.
#
#
# BUDGET GUARANTEE: every API call is wrapped by `timeout`. Reads taken while
# WAITING are capped by the budget REMAINING, so none can outlive the deadline.
# Reads taken AFTER a verdict is decided (reporting, not waiting) are capped by
# DIAGNOSTIC_BUDGET, so STATUS can land up to that many seconds past TIMEOUT —
# a bounded, deliberate tail rather than an open-ended one.
#
# STATUS reflects the MECHANICAL thread gate only. The review's VERDICT HEADLINE is
# still what drives triage, and it is printed in full below — read it.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# KNOWN GITHUB API BEHAVIOUR (empirically confirmed — do not "fix" these back)
#
# D1. The review request is inert as an evidence source.
#     POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/requested_reviewers with the Copilot
#     bot returns 200 with `requested_reviewers: []` — observed 7 times out of 7.
#     A follow-up GET is empty too. The POST is still worth issuing, because the
#     timeline sometimes does record a `review_requested` event and a review
#     arrives minutes later — but its response and `requested_reviewers` are
#     NEVER evidence of anything. Nothing below branches on them.
#
# D2. The GraphQL fallback cannot work. `requestReviews` rejects the bot outright:
#       Could not resolve to User node with the global id of 'BOT_kgDOCnlnWA'
#     `userIds` does not accept Bot nodes. There is no GraphQL path for requesting
#     a Copilot review; do not add one back as a "fallback".
#
# D3. Readiness must NOT be keyed on `requested_reviewers`. A previous version of
#     this script gated the poll on it and therefore reported "no Copilot review
#     requested" against reviews that were genuinely delivered — on one
#     PR it would have done so at every point in a 12 m 42 s window INCLUDING
#     after the review landed. On a repo with no auto-request ruleset the
#     documented recovery ("go request one, then re-run") looped forever, because
#     the request itself is a no-op (D1).
#
#     THE ONLY SOUND READINESS SIGNAL, and the one used below: poll
#     GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/reviews for a review whose `commit_id`
#     equals the PR's current `headRefOid`. Nothing has to be "requested" for that
#     to be true, and nothing being there yet does not mean nothing was requested.
#
# D4. A suppressed-comments block is INFORMATIONAL, not a gate. Copilot review
#     bodies can say "generated no new comments" while carrying a
#       <details><summary>Suppressed comments (N)</summary>
#     block. Those items open NO review thread — Copilot itself judged them not
#     worth raising as one — and they are overwhelmingly wording, casing, and
#     comment-phrasing nits. Acting on them is expensive, because every push
#     re-opens the review gate and costs another full wait cycle. The default is
#     to IGNORE them; a caller acts only on something absolutely dire. This script
#     still flags the block and emits `SUPPRESSED_COMMENTS=1|0|unknown`, because
#     knowing is free — but the flag never withholds the gate.
#
#     The check spans EVERY review of the target commit, not just the newest one.
#     Two reviews of one commit are routine (this script nudges on every head
#     move, and the skill re-runs it up to 3 times), so reading only the newest
#     body would report on a different review than the one being judged.
#
#     What DOES decide the outcome is the review's VERDICT HEADLINE:
#       "Approval recommended" / "Needs a closer look" -> pass, if no threads open
#       "Changes recommended"                          -> triage and resolve
#
# D5. The suppressed-comments check has THREE outcomes, and a failed fetch is not 0.
#     `review_bodies` used to end in `|| true`, so a transient `gh api` error
#     produced an empty string, the `Suppressed comments` grep matched nothing, and
#     the script printed SUPPRESSED_COMMENTS=0 plus "(review has an empty body)" —
#     reporting a result for a check that never ran. Keep the three states honest:
#     1 = block present, 0 = fetch succeeded and no block, `unknown` = fetch
#     FAILED. Distinguish the last two by `gh`'s EXIT STATUS, never by empty
#     output — a Copilot review with a genuinely empty body is legal and observed,
#     so "empty" and "unfetched" are different facts that look identical on stdout.
#     None of the three blocks the gate (D4); the distinction exists so the output
#     says what it knows rather than guessing.
#
# HEAD-SHA AWARENESS (do not remove):
#     Copilot does NOT re-review automatically when new commits are pushed unless
#     the repo ruleset enables "review new pushes". A version of this script that
#     matched *any* Copilot review on the PR exited 0 immediately after a fix was
#     pushed, reporting a review of the PREVIOUS commit as coverage for the new
#     one. Every check below is scoped to the current head SHA, the head is
#     re-read on every poll, and a match is re-confirmed against a fresh head read
#     before success is declared.
#
#     That re-confirmation FAILS CLOSED. `current_head_sha` swallows errors and
#     returns empty on a failed API read, so empty means "unknown", never
#     "unchanged". An earlier version treated empty as confirmation and could
#     print a superseded SHA as both REVIEWED_COMMIT_ID and PR_HEAD_SHA — making
#     the caller's mandated equality check pass on a stale review. A SHA pair is
#     now emitted ONLY from a head read that actually succeeded.
