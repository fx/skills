#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-codex-review.sh
# Runs a scoped, one-shot `codex review` of the current branch with every locally
# configured MCP server disabled.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-codex-review.sh <SCOPE_PROMPT_FILE>
#   ./run-codex-review.sh -                  # read the scope prompt from stdin
#
# Env:
#   CODEX_REVIEW_OUT=<path>    also tee the review to this file
#   CODEX_REVIEW_DRY_RUN=1     print the resolved command and exit 0 without running
#   CODEX_REVIEW_MODEL=<id>    override the review model     (default below)
#   CODEX_REVIEW_EFFORT=<lvl>  override reasoning effort     (default below)
#
# MODEL AND EFFORT ARE OVERRIDDEN PER INVOCATION, NEVER IN THE USER'S CONFIG.
# `codex review` otherwise inherits `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` from
# ~/.codex/config.toml, and a reasoning-heavy default turns every pass into a 10-15
# minute wait — which makes the convergence loop unaffordable long before the
# iteration bound. Do NOT trade down for speed: a cheaper model reported "no
# blocking defect" on a branch where the default below found a genuine P1, and a
# reviewer that finishes fast by finding nothing is not faster. Raise effort to
# `high` when you want every site of a class enumerated and can afford ~3x the wait.
#
# ⛔ NO TIMEOUT. Codex is one-shot and a real branch review takes many minutes; it
#    also buffers, so the output file stays empty until it finishes. Run this in the
#    BACKGROUND (`run_in_background: true`) and let the completion notification wake
#    you. Do NOT poll the output file and do NOT chain sleeps waiting on it — polling
#    a buffered process teaches you nothing and costs a full context read per poll.
#    The launch shape, and the discipline that governs it — including never
#    backgrounding a launch your host has already backgrounded — are the `dev`
#    skill's `references/background-waits.md`, which is the only place either is
#    written down. What THIS script owes that discipline is the sentinel it is read
#    against, below.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# COMPLETION CONTRACT
#
# The LAST line of stdout is always `STATUS=<state>`. A log with NO `STATUS=` tail
# is a RUNNING or DEAD run — never a finished one. Branch on that line, not on how
# much output the log happens to hold.
#
# "LAST" is load-bearing and is enforced, not hoped for: before the abort path emits
# ERROR it terminates and confirms the death of every descendant that inherited the
# log's file descriptor, because `codex review` outlives a signalled runner and would
# otherwise append review prose after the sentinel. See `reap_descendants` below.
#
#   STATUS=COMPLETED  exit = codex's own, WHATEVER IT IS — not a fixed set. This
#                     script passes `PIPESTATUS[0]` through unchanged, so 126, 127
#                     and 137 are as reachable as 0/1/2 and none of them is given a
#                     meaning here. `codex review` ran to completion. Its findings
#                     are on stdout; READ THEM. Accompanied by a mandatory
#                     `CODEX_EXIT=<n>` line.
#   STATUS=DRY_RUN    exit 0
#                     CODEX_REVIEW_DRY_RUN=1 — the resolved command was printed and
#                     no review ran.
#   STATUS=ERROR      exit 3 for the documented setup failures below; exit 4 from the
#                     EXIT trap on an internal abort; 128+N when signal N kills the
#                     runner (SIGTERM -> 143, SIGHUP -> 129). The review never
#                     started, or the runner died mid-flight.
#
# ⛔ THE ERROR EXIT CODE IS NOT A FIXED SET — WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY THE CALLER BRANCHES
# ON THE `STATUS=` LINE AND NOT ON THE NUMBER. The invariant that actually holds, and
# the only one worth depending on, is that `STATUS=ERROR` is emitted on EVERY one of
# those paths.
#
# `exit 4` in the EXIT trap is effective on the `set -e`/`set -u` abort path it exists
# for (verified), but it CANNOT override a signal-derived status: a signalled shell
# runs its EXIT trap — the STATUS line does get out — and still exits 128+N. Verified
# on TERM/HUP/USR1/USR2/PIPE. Do NOT "fix" this with a SIGTERM/SIGINT trap that forces
# 4: exiting 143 is correct Unix behaviour and strictly more informative than 4, the
# forcing would destroy that information, and it would buy nothing because the STATUS
# invariant above already holds. SIGKILL is the one case with no STATUS line at all —
# no trap can run — and that is precisely the "no `STATUS=` tail means running or
# dead" case the contract tells the caller to read.
#
# STATUS AND THE EXIT CODE ARE DECOUPLED ON PURPOSE. On COMPLETED the exit code is
# CODEX'S OWN and this script asserts NOTHING about it: `CODEX_EXIT=<n>` is reported
# and deliberately NOT interpreted, because a non-zero `codex review` exit does not
# distinguish "the reviewer failed" from "the reviewer had opinions" — read the
# findings to learn which. 3 and 4 are this script's own codes and are never codex's.
#
# Exit 3 covers exactly: a usage error, `codex` missing from PATH, an unreadable or
# empty scope prompt, and a failed MCP enumeration. Deliberately not 1 or 2 — those
# are reserved by `codex` itself, and conflating them would make "the reviewer
# failed" look like "the reviewer had opinions".
#
# WHY NOT THE FIVE-STATE PROTOCOL the polling waiters in this catalog use: there is
# no budget here and nothing can time out, so `PENDING` cannot occur; there is no
# configuration question to answer, so `NOT_CONFIGURED` cannot occur; and
# `TERMINAL_PASS`/`TERMINAL_FAIL` MUST NOT exist because this script HAS NO VERDICT
# — `TERMINAL_PASS` would be read as "no findings", which is the exact misread the
# exit-code notes above were written to prevent.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT
#
# Two things about `codex review` are easy to get wrong from prose, and both have
# cost real review cycles. The full analysis lives in the skill; the operational
# consequences are encoded here so they cannot be half-remembered.
#
# 1. THE SCOPE PROMPT IS MANDATORY, AND SCOPE FLAGS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WITH IT.
#    `codex review --base <BRANCH> "<PROMPT>"` is REJECTED:
#        error: the argument '--base <BRANCH>' cannot be used with '[PROMPT]'
#    The usage line prints that exact combination, which is why it keeps getting
#    tried. Since the brief must reach Codex — it is the only reviewer that can
#    receive it directly — the prompt-only form is the ONLY correct invocation, and
#    the changes must already be committed on a branch so Codex derives the diff
#    itself. A promptless run reports the work the change deliberately did not do.
#
# 2. MCP SERVERS MUST BE DISABLED INDIVIDUALLY, BY NAME.
#    A `codex review` that inherits the user's MCP servers can block indefinitely on
#    its first action, emitting nothing — observed twice on 0.147.0, each time
#    sitting 16+ minutes at ~0% CPU. There is no TTY to answer a stalled tool call
#    and `codex review` has no approval-policy flag, so the turn never advances.
#
#    `-c 'mcp_servers={}'` does NOT work — the map is merged, not replaced, so every
#    server stays loaded. It LOOKS like it worked, because a run that happens not to
#    call a tool shows no MCP output. Setting CODEX_HOME to a sanitized directory
#    does not work either.
#
#    Enumeration uses `codex mcp list --json`, never a `config.toml` scrape: servers
#    also arrive from project-scoped and managed configuration, and a scrape silently
#    misses those. That produces a PARTIAL flag set — the worst outcome, because the
#    command looks correct, most servers are disabled, and the one it missed hangs
#    the run exactly as before.
#
# These are per-invocation overrides. This script NEVER writes to ~/.codex/config.toml
# or ~/.codex/AGENTS.md — those are the user's, machine-wide, and a review has no
# business rewriting them.

# into the same log, so the line still reaches the caller. The `&&` short-circuits:
# the stderr write is attempted ONLY if the stdout write failed, so the log can never
# carry a duplicate STATUS line.

    echo "STATUS=$1" >&2 && return 0
    return 1
}

# ⛔ THE SENTINEL MUST NOT BE WRITTEN WHILE A CHILD CAN STILL WRITE TO THE LOG.
#
# `codex review` is a FOREGROUND PIPELINE MEMBER, not a job: when a signal kills this
# shell, that child is neither signalled nor reaped, it keeps the log file descriptor
# it inherited, and it appends AFTER the EXIT trap's `STATUS=` line. The log's last
# line is then review prose, so a caller reading the tail classifies a run that DID
# finish as "running or dead" — the exact misread the whole contract exists to remove,
# reintroduced on the signal path. Observed, not theorised.
#
# So: terminate every descendant, CONFIRM it is gone, and only then emit.
#
# Two shell facts this is built on, both verified here rather than assumed:
#
#   1. `wait` IS USELESS ON THE SIGNAL PATH. In an EXIT trap reached because a signal
#      terminated the shell, bash has already discarded its job table: `wait` with no
#      operands returns 0 immediately with children still running, and `wait <pid>`
#      fails with "pid N is not a child of this shell". Verified — a child that
#      ignores SIGTERM wrote to the log AFTER a trap that had "waited" for it.
#      `kill -0` still answers correctly for those PIDs, so polling it is the only
#      mechanism that actually observes the death.
#   2. ENUMERATION MUST BE BY PID, NEVER BY PATTERN. `pgrep -P <pid>` matches on
#      parent PID and excludes itself; `pgrep -f 'codex review'` matches its own
#      command line and spins forever, which is the defect
#      `dev/references/background-waits.md` forbids outright.
#
# This is the script's one soft dependency: with `pgrep` absent the reap becomes a
# no-op and the late-write hazard returns. Verified that it degrades quietly — the
# STATUS line and the 128+N exit are unaffected, nothing is printed — rather than
# aborting the trap. `pgrep` ships with procps-ng on Linux and in the macOS base
# system, so the degraded path is a fallback, not a case to design around.
#
# Deepest-first so a kill never orphans a grandchild that is still writing: a child
# of `codex` inherits this shell's stderr, which every documented launch redirects
# into the same log.
descendants_deepest_first() {
    local pid="$1" kid
    for kid in $(pgrep -P "$pid" 2>/dev/null || true); do
        descendants_deepest_first "$kid"
        printf '%s\n' "$kid"
    done
}

# Every command here is guarded. `set -e` is still in force inside the EXIT trap, and
# an unguarded failure — `kill` on a PID that already exited is the likely one —
# would abort the trap BEFORE `emit_status`, leaving no STATUS line at all. Bash does
# not re-run an EXIT trap that aborted, so there is no second chance.

        [[ -n "$alive" ]] || return 0
        sleep 0.1 || true
    done

    # No confirm loop after SIGKILL, deliberately. It cannot be blocked, so the target
    # never executes another instruction — the write hazard is over the moment it is
    # delivered. Polling `kill -0` here would be worse than useless: a killed child we
    # are unable to reap (the job table is gone, see above) lingers as a zombie, and

#      the header — aborts here, the EXIT trap fires, and the script reports
#      STATUS=ERROR for a review that DID complete. That inverts the contract. The
#      non-zero codex path MUST reach `finish COMPLETED`.
#   2. `... | tee "$OUT" || true` then reading `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`. ANY command after
#      the pipeline — `|| true` included — RESETS the array, so PIPESTATUS[0] is then
#      always 0 and every run looks like codex exited clean. Verified.
#
# Codex's status comes from pipe_status[0], NEVER from `$?`. Under `pipefail` `$?`
# collapses the whole pipeline into ONE number — the rightmost non-zero status — and
# that number carries no record of which command produced it. Verified: a clean
# `codex` plus an unwritable CODEX_REVIEW_OUT gives `$?`=1, and `codex` exiting 1
# through a healthy `tee` ALSO gives `$?`=1. Same number, opposite meanings — "the
# reviewer had opinions" and "the reviewer was clean but the file could not be
# written" are indistinguishable. `PIPESTATUS[0]` is the only way to attribute the
# status to codex specifically.
#
# `STATUS=`/`CODEX_EXIT=` reach stdout ONLY, never CODEX_REVIEW_OUT, because they are
# emitted AFTER the pipeline: `tee` sees only the pipeline's stdin. Keep it that way.
# CODEX_REVIEW_OUT is consumed as review TEXT, where a `STATUS=COMPLETED` line is
