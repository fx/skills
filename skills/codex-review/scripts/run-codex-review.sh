#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-codex-review.sh
# Runs a scoped, one-shot `codex review` of the current branch with every locally
# configured MCP server disabled.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-codex-review.sh <SCOPE_PROMPT_FILE>
#   ./run-codex-review.sh -                  # read the scope prompt from stdin
#
# Env:
#   CODEX_REVIEW_OUT=<path>    also tee the review to this file
#   CODEX_REVIEW_DRY_RUN=1     print the resolved command and exit 0 without running
#   CODEX_REVIEW_MODEL=<id>    override the review model     (default below)
#   CODEX_REVIEW_EFFORT=<lvl>  override reasoning effort     (default below)
#
# MODEL AND EFFORT ARE OVERRIDDEN PER INVOCATION, NEVER IN THE USER'S CONFIG.
# `codex review` otherwise inherits `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` from
# ~/.codex/config.toml, and a reasoning-heavy default turns every pass into a 10-15
# minute wait — which makes the convergence loop unaffordable long before the
# iteration bound. Do NOT trade down for speed: a cheaper model reported "no
# blocking defect" on a branch where the default below found a genuine P1, and a
# reviewer that finishes fast by finding nothing is not faster. Raise effort to
# `high` when you want every site of a class enumerated and can afford ~3x the wait.
#
# ⛔ NO TIMEOUT. Codex is one-shot and a real branch review takes many minutes; it
#    also buffers, so the output file stays empty until it finishes. Run this in the
#    BACKGROUND (`run_in_background: true`) and let the completion notification wake
#    you. Do NOT poll the output file and do NOT chain sleeps waiting on it — polling
#    a buffered process teaches you nothing and costs a full context read per poll.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Codex ran to completion. Its findings are on stdout; READ THEM. A zero exit
#       means the review ran, NOT that it found nothing.
#   3 - Usage error, `codex` missing, or the scope prompt was empty. The review
#       never started. (Deliberately not 1 or 2 — those are reserved by `codex`
#       itself, and conflating them would make "the reviewer failed" look like "the
#       reviewer had opinions".)
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT
#
# Two things about `codex review` are easy to get wrong from prose, and both have
# cost real review cycles. The full analysis lives in the skill; the operational
# consequences are encoded here so they cannot be half-remembered.
#
# 1. THE SCOPE PROMPT IS MANDATORY, AND SCOPE FLAGS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WITH IT.
#    `codex review --base <BRANCH> "<PROMPT>"` is REJECTED:
#        error: the argument '--base <BRANCH>' cannot be used with '[PROMPT]'
#    The usage line prints that exact combination, which is why it keeps getting
#    tried. Since the brief must reach Codex — it is the only reviewer that can
#    receive it directly — the prompt-only form is the ONLY correct invocation, and
#    the changes must already be committed on a branch so Codex derives the diff
#    itself. A promptless run reports the work the change deliberately did not do.
#
# 2. MCP SERVERS MUST BE DISABLED INDIVIDUALLY, BY NAME.
#    A `codex review` that inherits the user's MCP servers can block indefinitely on
#    its first action, emitting nothing — observed twice on 0.147.0, each time
#    sitting 16+ minutes at ~0% CPU. There is no TTY to answer a stalled tool call
#    and `codex review` has no approval-policy flag, so the turn never advances.
#
#    `-c 'mcp_servers={}'` does NOT work — the map is merged, not replaced, so every
#    server stays loaded. It LOOKS like it worked, because a run that happens not to
#    call a tool shows no MCP output. Setting CODEX_HOME to a sanitized directory
#    does not work either.
#
#    Enumeration uses `codex mcp list --json`, never a `config.toml` scrape: servers
#    also arrive from project-scoped and managed configuration, and a scrape silently
#    misses those. That produces a PARTIAL flag set — the worst outcome, because the
#    command looks correct, most servers are disabled, and the one it missed hangs
#    the run exactly as before.
#
# These are per-invocation overrides. This script NEVER writes to ~/.codex/config.toml
# or ~/.codex/AGENTS.md — those are the user's, machine-wide, and a review has no
# business rewriting them.
