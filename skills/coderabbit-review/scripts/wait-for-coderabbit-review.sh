#!/usr/bin/env bash
# wait-for-coderabbit-review.sh
# Polls a PR for CodeRabbit review completion via the "CodeRabbit" GitHub check
# context. CodeRabbit auto-runs on every PR (no request needed) and re-runs every
# time the head SHA changes — so this script is also used to wait for re-review
# cycles after pushing fixes.
#
# Usage: ./wait-for-coderabbit-review.sh <PR_NUMBER> [TIMEOUT_SECONDS]
# Default timeout: 900 seconds (15 minutes).
#
# ⛔ RUN THIS IN THE BACKGROUND (`run_in_background: true`), redirecting stdout and
#    stderr to a log file. The Bash tool caps a FOREGROUND `timeout` at 600 000 ms,
#    which is BELOW this script's budget — a foreground call is guaranteed to be
#    killed mid-poll, printing no STATUS and no exit code, which is precisely what
#    made callers re-run it blindly. Backgrounded processes are not subject to that
#    cap.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# STATUS PROTOCOL (shared by every wait script in this catalog)
#
# The LAST line of stdout is always `STATUS=<state>`, and the exit code mirrors it.
# Read the STATUS line; it is the primary signal. The exit code is a convenience.
#
#   STATUS=TERMINAL_PASS   exit 0  Check settled clean AND no unresolved threads.
#   STATUS=TERMINAL_FAIL   exit 1  Check settled with a failing conclusion, or
#                                  unresolved CodeRabbit threads remain. Settled
#                                  either way — do NOT re-run to "get a better
#                                  answer"; triage what it said.
#   STATUS=PENDING         exit 2  Still in progress when the budget expired. NOT a
#                                  verdict and NOT a failure. Re-running is safe and
#                                  is the correct response if you still need it.
#   STATUS=NOT_CONFIGURED  exit 3  No CodeRabbit check on this PR after a grace
#                                  period — the GitHub App is not installed for this
#                                  repo. TERMINAL. Never retry, never wait: most
#                                  repos do not use CodeRabbit and this is the
#                                  expected, correct outcome for them.
#   STATUS=ERROR           exit 4  Bad arguments, `gh` too old, repo/PR unresolvable.
#                                  The wait never started. A real failure.
#
# The distinction between PENDING and TERMINAL_FAIL is the point of this protocol.
# Conflating them is what previously forced callers into blind re-run loops.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#
# BUDGET GUARANTEE: every API call is wrapped by `timeout`. Reads taken while
# WAITING are capped by the budget REMAINING, so none can outlive the deadline.
# Reads taken AFTER a verdict is decided (reporting, not waiting) are capped by
# DIAGNOSTIC_BUDGET, so STATUS can land up to that many seconds past TIMEOUT —
# a bounded, deliberate tail rather than an open-ended one.
#
# Additional machine-readable lines emitted before STATUS:
#   CHECK_CONCLUSION=<state>          the CodeRabbit check's terminal state
#   UNRESOLVED_THREADS=<n|unknown>    `unknown` means the GraphQL read FAILED, not
#                                     that there are none — see below.

# Started HERE, before ANY API call — preflight included. `SECONDS` counts from
# shell start, so a reset placed later left the preflight calls outside the budget

# than the whole budget allowed before it even began waiting. One clock, started
# before the first network byte, bounds the entire run.

# ─── Budget enforcement for API calls ────────────────────────────────────────
# Deadline CHECKS only stop the next poll from STARTING; they do nothing about a
# request already in flight. A hung `gh` call started one second before the
# deadline delays STATUS indefinitely, which defeats the whole point of an
# advertised wall-clock bound. So every API call is wrapped by one of two caps:
#
#   wait_cap  — for reads taken while WAITING. Capped by the budget REMAINING, so
#               no read can outlive the deadline.
#   DIAGNOSTIC_BUDGET — for reads taken AFTER a verdict is already decided (that
#               is, reporting, not waiting). STATUS can therefore land up to this
#               many seconds past TIMEOUT; that tail is bounded and deliberate.
#
# ⚠️ `timeout 0 CMD` DISABLES the timeout in coreutils — it does not expire
# immediately. A zero cap must therefore SKIP the call, never pass 0 to `timeout`.
# Callers check `budget_exhausted` before any waiting read.
