This skill manages project tasks and documentation for AI-driven development. Work is tracked in:
- **`docs/changes/NNNN-name.md`** — Feature-level task lists tied to specific change documents
- **`docs/tasks.md`** — Catch-all task list for work not tied to a specific change
- **External tools** — GitHub Issues or Jira when configured in the project's AGENTS.md

## Core Principles

1. **Changes are primary** — Most feature work SHOULD be tracked in `docs/changes/` documents, not in `docs/tasks.md`. Change documents are what `/team` and `/dev` consume.
2. **Approved change documents are implementation contracts** — Once the user approves implementation of a change document, that document—together with the spec sections it links and all mandatory project rules—is the implementation contract. Its requirements, tasks, design decisions, dependencies, and non-goals/out-of-scope boundary define the allowed implementation boundary. Discovery during implementation does not silently expand that boundary. Any new product behavior, architecture, subsystem, cross-cutting policy, or additional task MUST first be written into the change document and approved by the user; until then, record it as follow-up/out-of-scope and do not implement it. Mandatory project rules and demonstrable regressions introduced by the branch remain blocking even when the document does not mention them. Clarifications that do not change observable behavior or architecture may be recorded without reapproval.
3. **NEVER duplicate tasks** — Tasks that exist in a `docs/changes/` document MUST NOT be copied, summarized, or mirrored into `docs/tasks.md`. Each task lives in exactly one place. `docs/tasks.md` is ONLY for orphan work not tied to any change document.
4. **One task = one PR** — Every top-level task represents work that results in a single pull request.
5. **Smaller PRs are better** — Prefer many focused PRs over few large ones.
6. **Clarify before acting** — Use AskUserQuestion to resolve ambiguity.
7. **Research first** — Understand requirements before planning.

## When This Skill Triggers

**CRITICAL:** Load this skill BEFORE reading, modifying, or editing `docs/tasks.md` or task lists in `docs/changes/`. Do not use Read/Edit tools on these files without loading this skill first.

**Load this skill IMMEDIATELY when:**
- About to modify `docs/tasks.md` or `## Tasks` in `docs/changes/` files
- Mentions tasks.md, changes/, "the task file", "task list"
- Says: "add a task", "new task", "track this"
- Says: "mark as done", "mark complete", "check off", "finished this"
- Says: "next task", "what's next", "work on next"
- Discusses tasks, features, or project tracking
- Asks to create tickets, issues, or feature documentation
- Says "add a feature that does X" or "improve X to allow Y"
- Asks to plan, break down, or organize work

## Task Source Priority

When looking for tasks, adding tasks, or marking completion, follow this strict priority:

1. **Check `docs/changes/`** FIRST — Scan change documents for uncompleted `- [ ]` tasks. These are the primary work items. If work relates to an existing spec or change document, tasks MUST go here.
2. **Check `docs/tasks.md`** ONLY for orphan work — Tasks that do not relate to any spec or change document. Before adding a task here, verify no relevant change document exists. If a relevant spec exists, create a change document for the work instead.
3. **Check external tools** — If AGENTS.md specifies GitHub Issues or Jira preference.

**Strong default to change documents:** When the user asks to add or track work that relates to any existing spec in `docs/specs/`, ALWAYS create or find a change document for it. NEVER put spec-related work in `docs/tasks.md`. If no change document exists yet, propose creating one.

## External Task Tracking

Projects MAY define a preference for external task tracking in their AGENTS.md. Look for patterns like:
- `task-tracking: github-issues`
- `task-tracking: jira`
- "Use GitHub Issues for task tracking"
- "Track tasks in Jira project X"

**When external tracking is configured:**
1. Load the GitHub skill (`Skill tool: skill="github"`) if using GitHub
2. Create issues/tickets in the external tool
3. Keep `docs/tasks.md` as a lightweight reference linking to external items
4. Mark completion in BOTH the external tool and `docs/tasks.md` or change documents

**When no external tracking is configured:**
Default to `docs/tasks.md` and `docs/changes/` task lists.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Requests

When user says "add a feature that does X" or "improve X to allow Y":

1. **Analyze deeply** using Explore and tech-scout sub-agents
2. **Check if a relevant spec exists** in `docs/specs/`
3. **Determine scope** — Single PR? Multiple PRs? Needs a change document?
4. **If multi-PR**: Invoke `/spec-writer` to create or update the spec and propose change documents
5. **If single PR**: Add to `docs/tasks.md` and proceed to implementation
6. **Get approval** then begin work

### Workflow 2: "Work on Next"

When user says "work on next", "next task", "what's next":

1. **Scan `docs/changes/`** for change documents with status `in-progress` or `draft` that have uncompleted tasks
2. **Scan `docs/tasks.md`** for uncompleted items (top = highest priority)
3. **Check external tools** if configured
4. **Select next uncompleted task** — prioritize in-progress changes over new work
5. **Announce the task** to user
6. **Execute using development sub-agents**
7. **Mark task complete** with PR number in the file where it lives
8. **Ensure PR includes the task-list update**

### Workflow 3: Break Down Tasks for a Change Document

When instructed to break down tasks for a change document or spec:

1. **Read the document** to understand scope and design
2. **Explore the codebase** to understand what needs to change
3. **Write tasks** as nested markdown checkboxes in the `## Tasks` section:
   ```markdown
   ## Tasks

   - [ ] Task one — brief description
     - [ ] Subtask if needed
   - [ ] Task two — brief description
   ```
4. **Scope each top-level task to one PR**
5. **Be specific** — include file paths, function names, test requirements
6. **Do not duplicate** — if another change document already tracks related work, reference it
7. **Define the contract boundary before approval** — Make scope explicit through the Requirements and **Non-Goals** (or **Out of Scope**) sections, and map every top-level task to a contract requirement. Approval freezes this scope; later product or architecture expansion follows the amendment-and-approval rule in Core Principles.

### Workflow 4: Initial Setup

When `docs/tasks.md` doesn't exist:

1. **Invoke the fx-setup skill:**
   ```
   Skill tool: skill="fx-setup"
   ```
2. **Ask about tracking preferences** via AskUserQuestion:
   - "Use docs/tasks.md + docs/changes/ (default)"
   - "Use GitHub Issues + docs/changes/"
   - "Other (Jira, Linear, etc.)"
3. **Migrate existing tracking** (PROJECT.md, TODO.md, STATUS.md) if present

### Workflow 5: Update Indexes (CRITICAL — MUST NOT BE SKIPPED)

**After ANY change document status change (draft → in-progress → complete), update ALL THREE locations in the SAME PR:**

1. **Update the change document itself** — Set `**Status:** complete` (or `in-progress`) in the frontmatter
2. **Update `docs/index.yml`** — Update the `status:` field for the affected change entry
3. **Update `docs/index.md`** — Update the status in the corresponding table row

**All three updates MUST be included in the same commit/PR that marks tasks complete.** Never leave the index files stale — they are the primary way contributors discover change document status. Forgetting to sync indexes causes massive drift that requires manual cleanup.

## Pre-Flight: Run Setup

**Every time this skill is invoked**, run the fx-setup skill first to ensure docs structure and instruction files are in place:

```
Skill tool: skill="fx-setup"
```

This is fast and idempotent — it checks what exists and only creates/modifies what's missing. It handles:
- `docs/` folder structure (specs/, changes/, tasks.md, index.yml, index.md)
- `AGENTS.md` task-tracking instructions (+ the `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md` pointer)
- `REVIEW.md` PR review instructions (+ `.coderabbit.yaml` pointing CodeRabbit at it)

---

## Critical Requirements

### Every Task Completion MUST:

1. Mark task complete in the file where the task lives: `- [x] Task`, plus `(PR #N)` where the PR number is already known. The annotation is **optional** — see item 6: tracking is written with the implementation, before the PR exists, and a completed task is never held back or re-committed for the sake of adding a number the merge commit already records.
2. Task lists may be in `docs/tasks.md` OR in `docs/changes/*.md` files
3. If ALL tasks in a change document are now complete, update its `**Status:**` to `complete`
4. **Sync indexes** — Update `docs/index.yml` and `docs/index.md` to reflect the new status (see Workflow 5)
5. Include ALL of the above updates in the same PR
6. **Write them with the implementation, not after the PR's gates have run** — step 5 of `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/head-discipline.md` § The candidate head. `(PR #N)` is unknown before the PR exists: add it if another push is going out anyway, otherwise leave it off. It is never worth a commit of its own.

### Before Creating Tasks:

1. Verify task is atomic (single PR scope)
2. Ensure description is clear and actionable
3. Prefer placing tasks in change documents over `docs/tasks.md`
4. **Check if a change document already tracks this work** — if so, add the task there, NEVER in `docs/tasks.md`

### When Ambiguity Exists:

1. ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion to clarify
2. Present concrete options
3. Wait for user decision before proceeding
