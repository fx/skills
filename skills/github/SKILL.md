# GitHub CLI Expert

Comprehensive guidance for working with the GitHub CLI (`gh`) including common pitfalls, GraphQL patterns, and self-improvement workflows.

## Purpose

To provide reliable, tested patterns for GitHub operations and prevent repeating known mistakes with the `gh` CLI.

## Invocation Boundary

Use this skill only when the user explicitly invokes or names it, or when an active explicitly invoked workflow calls `github` by name. Do not auto-load it merely because a standalone request mentions GitHub, a pull request, `gh`, GraphQL, review threads, or merging. Handle ordinary GitHub operations directly unless the user selected this guidance or an active workflow requires it.

## Prerequisites

### GitHub CLI Version

**CRITICAL**: Many features require a recent `gh` CLI version. Before using this skill:

1. **Check current version:**
   ```bash
   gh --version
   ```

2. **Compare with latest release:**
   - Check https://github.com/cli/cli/releases for the current stable version
   - If your version is >6 months old, upgrade

3. **Upgrade `gh` CLI:**

   **Preferred method (mise):**
   ```bash
   mise use -g gh@latest
   ```

   **Alternative (apt):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gh
   ```

   **Why mise is preferred:**
   - Always gets the latest version (apt repos lag behind)
   - No sudo required
   - Consistent across environments

4. **Verify upgrade:**
   ```bash
   gh --version
   # Should show version 2.80+ (as of Dec 2025)
   ```

**Known version issues:**
- `gh < 2.20`: Limited GraphQL mutation support
- `gh < 2.40`: Missing `--body-file` flag on `gh pr edit`
- `gh < 2.50`: Incomplete review thread APIs

## ⛔ PR Comments Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**NEVER leave comments directly on GitHub PRs.** This is strictly forbidden:

- ❌ `gh pr review --comment` - FORBIDDEN
- ❌ `gh pr comment` - FORBIDDEN
- ❌ `gh api` mutations that create new reviews or PR-level comments - FORBIDDEN
- ❌ Responding to human review comments - FORBIDDEN

**The ONLY permitted interaction with review threads:**
- ✅ Reply to EXISTING threads created by **GitHub Copilot only** using `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply`
- ✅ Resolve Copilot threads using `resolveReviewThread`

**Never respond to or interact with human reviewer comments.** Only automated Copilot feedback should be addressed.

## ⛔ PR Merge Requirements (CRITICAL — BLOCKING)

**NEVER run `gh pr merge` without verifying ALL of the following gates. No exceptions for PR size, urgency, or any other reason.**

| Gate | Verification | Blocking? |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| CI checks ALL green | `gh pr checks <NUMBER>` — every check must show `pass` | ⛔ YES |
| Copilot review RECEIVED **for the commit being merged** | A Copilot review whose `commit_id` equals the PR's current `headRefOid` — see the scoped command below. A review of ANY older commit does NOT satisfy this gate | ⛔ YES |
| Copilot verdict READ | The reviewed body's verdict headline. *Approval recommended* and *Needs a closer look* both pass when no threads are open; *Changes recommended* must be worked through. A suppressed-comments block is ignored by default and gates nothing | ⛔ YES |
| Copilot comments RESOLVED | All **Copilot-authored** review threads resolved (0 unresolved). Filter on the Copilot login — human threads are out of scope and must never be touched | ⛔ YES |
| CodeRabbit review attempted (if GitHub App configured) | Prefer a received review; explicit `skipped (rate-limited)` is acceptable | Optional when rate-limited |
| CodeRabbit comments resolved (if received) | Resolve **every** thread CodeRabbit already posted, rate limit or not. Throttling waives the review passes that never ran, never a thread already on the PR | ⛔ YES for delivered threads |
| Codecov passing | `codecov/patch` and `codecov/project` checks pass | ⛔ YES |

> **CodeRabbit is PR-level only** — see `coderabbit-review`. There is no local CodeRabbit pass; the `cr` CLI is not used, and Codex is the only local pre-PR reviewer (`dev` Step 4.5). The PR-level review applies only when the GitHub App auto-reviews PRs; its waiter reports `STATUS=NOT_CONFIGURED` otherwise, which is terminal and expected for most repos. **CodeRabbit is optional when it reports a rate/quota limit or cooldown:** report once, resolve findings already received **and settle every thread it already posted**, record `skipped (rate-limited)`, and continue without waiting or retrying. The degradation waives the passes that never ran, never work already on the PR. Other merge gates remain mandatory.

Verify the Copilot gate with a **head-SHA-scoped** query — an unscoped one accepts a
review of a superseded commit as coverage for the code you are about to merge:

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')          # or set it explicitly: PR_NUMBER=123
REPO_NWO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')
gh api "/repos/${REPO_NWO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/reviews" \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login | startswith(\"copilot-pull-request-reviewer\")) | select(.commit_id == \"${HEAD_SHA}\")] | length"
```

A result of `0` means **the commit you are about to merge is UNREVIEWED**, whatever
older reviews the PR carries.

**If a Copilot review of the current head has NOT been received:** WAIT — using
`copilot-review`, which owns the head-SHA-aware waiter. **Do not hand-roll a
polling loop here.** Hand-rolled loops reliably accept a review of a superseded
commit and re-derive the broken `requested_reviewers` readiness check. Do NOT merge
without it.

**Incident context:** A "small follow-up" PR was merged without waiting for Copilot review. Copilot found 5 real bugs (timing drift, race conditions, missing tests) that shipped to main. PR size is NEVER a reason to skip review gates.

## ⛔ Release PR Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**NEVER merge release PRs.** This includes PRs created by:

- ❌ release-please (`chore(main): release X.Y.Z`)
- ❌ semantic-release
- ❌ changesets (`Version Packages`)
- ❌ Any automated versioning/release bot

Release PRs control package versioning. Merging them autonomously can publish unintended major/minor versions, which is irreversible. **The user must always merge release PRs manually.**

If a workflow requires a new version to be published (e.g., updating a dependency after an upstream PR merges), STOP and inform the user:

> A release PR exists. Please merge it manually when ready, then confirm so I can proceed.

## Core Principles

### 1. Verify All Operations

Always verify that `gh` commands produced the expected result:

```bash
# After editing PR description
gh pr edit 13 --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
gh pr view 13 --json body -q .body | head -20  # Verify it worked

# After resolving threads
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { ... }'
gh api graphql -f query='query { ... }' --jq '.data'  # Verify resolution
```

### 2. Prefer GitHub API for Complex Operations

For multi-step operations or data transformations, use `gh api graphql` directly:

```bash
# More reliable than chaining CLI commands
gh api graphql -f query='...' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest'
```

### 3. Use Correct Methods for Each Task

Check `references/known-issues.md` before attempting operations that have failed before. Common issues include:

- PR description updates with heredocs
- Review thread resolution vs. PR comments
- Command substitution in heredoc strings

### 4. Follow Messaging Conventions

**Be Direct and Concise:**
- All PR descriptions, commit messages, and comments must be direct and to the point
- Eliminate unnecessary prose and filler content
- Focus on what changed and why, not how the work was organized

**⛔ Never hard-wrap anything GitHub renders as markdown:**

PR descriptions, PR/issue comments, and issue bodies MUST NOT be hard-wrapped at 80 columns — or any column. GitHub reflows markdown to the reader's viewport, so manual line breaks only produce ragged text that re-wraps badly on narrow screens. **Write each paragraph as ONE long line** and let it soft-wrap.

Commit messages are the **opposite**: git renders them as plain text, so wrap commit bodies at ~72 columns as usual. The rule follows the renderer, not the content.

| Target | Wrap? |
|---|---|
| Commit message body | Yes, ~72 columns |
| PR description / PR comment / issue body | **No — one line per paragraph** |

```markdown
❌ WRONG — hard-wrapped PR body, renders ragged on GitHub
## Summary
Standardizes every skill on two canonical instruction files, with a
pointer for each tool that cannot read them natively.

✅ RIGHT — one line per paragraph, GitHub reflows it
## Summary
Standardizes every skill on two canonical instruction files, with a pointer for each tool that cannot read them natively.
```

This applies however the body is authored — heredoc, `--body-file`, or `gh api -F body=@file`. Tables, lists, and fenced code blocks keep their own line structure; the rule is about prose paragraphs.

**Use Conventional Formats:**
- **Commit messages**: Follow conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- **PR titles**: MUST use conventional commit format — `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`, `fix(api): handle null token`). **BLOCKING**: on squash-merge the PR title becomes the commit subject, so a plain prose title (no `type:` prefix) permanently pollutes a conventional-commit history. **Canonical check** — every PR title, no matter who creates it (pr-preparer, the `/dev` workflow, or a `/team` coordinator running `gh pr create` directly), MUST match this regex; verify before creating AND before merging:
  ```bash
  gh pr view <N> --json title -q .title | grep -Eq '^(feat|fix|docs|refactor|chore|test|perf|build|ci|style|revert)(\(.+\))?!?: .+' \
    && echo "OK: conventional" || echo "⛔ NOT conventional — gh pr edit <N> --title \"type(scope): …\""
  ```
  A prose title like `Add anti-fabrication grounding rules` is FORBIDDEN — reform it (`feat(scope): add anti-fabrication grounding rules`). Creating the PR directly (not via pr-preparer) does NOT exempt you from this.
- **Branch names**: Use conventional naming (e.g., `feat/user-auth`, `fix/login-bug`)
- **Comments**: Use conventional comment markers where applicable

**Content Rules:**
- Describe the work being done and changes being made
- **Never mention** in the title: implementation phases, waves, steps of a process, project management terminology, workflow stages, or change-doc numbers
- **Never include** in the title: "Phase 1", "Step 2", "Part 3", "Wave 4", "First iteration", "Initial implementation", "0004-..."
- These belong in the PR **body** (description) if anywhere — never the title

### ⛔ The `#<number>` PR-Title Rule (CRITICAL — BLOCKING)

**A `#` immediately followed by a number — `#4`, `(#4)`, `#123` — in a PR title is a latent reference to PR/issue #N in the target repo.** The title bar itself renders it as plain text, so it looks harmless — but on **squash merge with GitHub's default commit-message setting, the PR title becomes the merge commit's subject line**, and `#N` in a *commit message* DOES auto-link and create a hard cross-reference to PR/issue #N. So a title saying `(#4)` to mean "implementation wave 4" ends up permanently cross-linking your merged commit (and the PR) to whatever PR/issue #4 happens to be. This has repeatedly created messy, wrong cross-links on `main`.

**Rules — no exceptions:**

1. **NEVER put `#<number>` in a PR title to mean anything other than a real PR/issue reference.** Implementation waves, phases, steps, parts, iterations, change-doc numbers (`0004`), and task numbers are FORBIDDEN as `#N` in titles.
2. **A `#<number>` is allowed in a title ONLY if N is a genuine, existing PR or issue in the target repo that this PR is actually about** — and even then, prefer putting the reference in the body (`Closes #123`). If you're not certain the number maps to a real PR/issue on this exact repo, do NOT write it.
3. **Do NOT pre-add a `(#N)` suffix.** When squash-merging with the default commit-message setting, GitHub appends `(#<real-PR-number>)` to the commit subject for you — a hand-added `(#4)` either duplicates or contradicts it. Leave your title clean and let GitHub add the real number at merge time.
4. To reference a change document or wave in the body, write the **path** (`docs/changes/0004-add-oauth.md`) or plain words ("the second batch of tasks") — never `#0004`, `#4`, or `(#4)`.

**Examples:**

✅ **Good PR Title** (no `#N`, no wave/phase):
```
feat: add user authentication with JWT tokens
```

❌ **Bad PR Title** (`(#4)` means "wave 4" — becomes the squash-merge commit subject and cross-links to PR/issue #4):
```
feat: add user authentication (#4)
```

❌ **Bad PR Title** (phase/wave in title):
```
feat: add user authentication - Phase 1: Initial Implementation
```

✅ **Allowed** only when #123 is a real issue this PR resolves on this repo (prefer doing this in the body instead):
```
fix: resolve login timeout reported in #123
```

✅ **Good Commit Message:**
```
fix: resolve login timeout issue

- Increase session timeout to 30 minutes
- Add retry logic for failed auth requests

Fixes #456
```

❌ **Bad Commit Message:**
```
fix: resolve login timeout issue - Step 2 of authentication refactor

This is the second phase of our authentication improvements...
```

✅ **Good Branch Name:**
```
feat/jwt-authentication
fix/login-timeout
```

❌ **Bad Branch Name:**
```
feat/authentication-phase-1
fix/login-step-2
```

## Recognizing Repository References

When users refer to repositories, recognize the `owner/repo` shorthand format and expand it appropriately.

### Shorthand Format

The pattern `owner/repo` (e.g., `fx/dotfiles`, `anthropics/claude-code`) refers to a GitHub repository. Always expand this to a full URL.

### Examples

| User says | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| "clone fx/dotfiles" | Clone `git@github.com:fx/dotfiles.git` |
| "look at anthropics/claude-code" | Repository at `github.com/anthropics/claude-code` |
| "fork vercel/next.js" | Fork from `github.com/vercel/next.js` |

### Clone Priority

When cloning, **always try SSH first**, then fall back to `gh` CLI:

```bash
# User: "clone fx/dotfiles"

# 1. Try SSH first (preferred)
git clone git@github.com:fx/dotfiles.git

# 2. If SSH fails, use gh CLI (handles auth automatically)
gh repo clone fx/dotfiles
```

### URL Expansion Rules

| Shorthand | SSH URL | HTTPS URL |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `owner/repo` | `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` | `https://github.com/owner/repo.git` |
| `fx/dotfiles` | `git@github.com:fx/dotfiles.git` | `https://github.com/fx/dotfiles.git` |

**IMPORTANT:** Never prompt the user to clarify `owner/repo` references - assume GitHub and proceed with cloning.

## Git Operations via `gh` CLI

When SSH keys aren't configured or `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` proxying fails, use `gh` CLI for git operations. The `gh` CLI handles authentication automatically when logged in.

### Check Authentication Status

Before using `gh` for git operations, verify authentication:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If authenticated, `gh` can handle cloning, pushing, and other git operations without SSH keys.

### Clone Repositories

**Preferred approach when SSH works:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:owner/repo.git
```

**Alternative via `gh` (no SSH required):**
```bash
gh repo clone owner/repo
```

This uses HTTPS with automatic token authentication - no SSH key needed.

### Configure Git to Use `gh` for Authentication

Set up git to use `gh` as a credential helper for HTTPS:

```bash
gh auth setup-git
```

This configures git to use `gh` for HTTPS authentication, allowing standard git commands to work:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
git push origin main
```

### When to Use `gh` vs SSH

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| SSH key configured and working | `git clone git@github.com:...` |
| No SSH key, but `gh auth status` shows logged in | `gh repo clone ...` or HTTPS with `gh auth setup-git` |
| Coder workspace with broken `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` | `gh repo clone ...` |
| CI/CD with `GITHUB_TOKEN` | HTTPS with token auth |

### Common `gh` Git Operations

```bash
# Clone
gh repo clone owner/repo
gh repo clone owner/repo -- --depth 1  # Shallow clone

# Fork and clone
gh repo fork owner/repo --clone

# View repo info
gh repo view owner/repo

# Create repo
gh repo create my-repo --private --clone
```

## Common Operations

### Create Pull Requests

**CRITICAL — NEVER create draft PRs:**

ALL pull requests MUST be created READY FOR REVIEW. **Never use `--draft`.** Never include "draft" / "WIP" / "for review" language in the title or body. The full review/CI cycle (CI checks, Copilot, CodeRabbit, codecov) runs from the moment the PR opens — drafting it has been used repeatedly as an excuse to skip those steps.

**Workflow:**
1. Create the PR ready for review (no `--draft` flag)
2. Run the full review/CI cycle (handled by `dev` Steps 6 and 7)
3. Merge once all gates pass and the user approves

**Correct approach:**
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: add feature" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
...
EOF
)"
```

**Never use `--draft`. Never run `gh pr ready` as a workaround for having opened a draft.** If the work isn't ready for review, don't open the PR yet — finish it first.

### Update PR Description

**Recommended approach** (most reliable):

```bash
# Write description to file first
cat > /tmp/pr-body.md <<'EOF'
## Summary
...
EOF

# Update via GitHub API
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/13 -X PATCH -F body=@/tmp/pr-body.md
```

See `references/known-issues.md` for failed approaches and why they don't work.

### Resolve Copilot Review Threads

**ONLY resolve threads created by GitHub Copilot.** Never interact with human review threads.

Use GraphQL mutations to resolve Copilot threads:

```bash
# Get thread ID (must be a Copilot thread)
THREAD_ID="RT_kwDOQipvu86RqL7d"

# Resolve it
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
      thread { id isResolved }
    }
  }' -f threadId="$THREAD_ID"
```

**Reminder:** `gh pr review --comment` is FORBIDDEN. See the PR Comments Prohibition section above.

### Get PR Information

```bash
# Simple PR view
gh pr view 13

# Get specific fields as JSON
gh pr view 13 --json title,body,state,reviewThreads

# Filter with jq
gh pr view 13 --json reviewThreads --jq '.reviewThreads[] | select(.isResolved == false)'
```

## Copilot Review Management

GitHub Copilot can automatically review pull requests. This section covers how to check review status and manage Copilot reviews.

### Key Facts

- **Copilot username**: `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` (GraphQL) or `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` (REST API)
- **Review state**: Copilot only leaves `COMMENTED` state reviews, never `APPROVED` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
- **Reviews are per-commit**: each review carries a `commit_id`. A review of an earlier commit says nothing about the current head.
- **Pushing does NOT re-trigger a review** unless the repo's ruleset enables "Review new pushes". Assume it does not.

### Request Copilot to Review a PR

**A Copilot review CAN be requested via the API** — add the bot as a requested reviewer:

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')          # or set it explicitly: PR_NUMBER=123
REPO_NWO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
gh api --method POST "/repos/${REPO_NWO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/requested_reviewers" \
  --input - <<'EOF'
{"reviewers":["copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]"]}
EOF
```

**The response to this POST is not evidence of anything.** It returns 200 with an
empty `requested_reviewers` array regardless, and a `422` is equally
uninformative — neither tells you whether a review is coming. Issue it and ignore
the result. The only sound signal is a review whose `commit_id` equals the PR's
current `headRefOid`; see `copilot-review` ("Known GitHub API Behaviour",
D1–D3) and use that skill, which wraps this together with a head-SHA-aware waiter.

**Do this again after every push to the PR branch.** Copilot will not reliably look at new commits on its own, and a stale review must never be read as coverage for the current head.

Other ways a review can be triggered, none of which replace the request above:

1. **Automatic reviews via repository rulesets**
   - Configure in repo Settings → Rules → Rulesets
   - Enable "Automatically request Copilot code review" (first review on PR open only)
   - Optionally enable "Review new pushes" for re-reviews on each commit — **off by default**
2. **GitHub UI** — Open PR → Reviewers → "Copilot"; the re-request button (🔄) forces a fresh pass

### ⛔ There Is No Way to Check Whether a Copilot Review Is "Pending"

**Do not try.** `reviewRequests` / `requested_reviewers` is **empirically always
empty** for the Copilot bot — 200 with `requested_reviewers: []` every time, and the
GraphQL `reviewRequests` node is empty too, including while a review is genuinely on
its way and after it has landed. See `copilot-review` (**D1**/**D3**).

Because that field is always empty, an "if non-empty → pending" check has only one
reachable branch: the negative one. Wired into a workflow it concludes "nobody asked
Copilot to review" on every PR, forever — which is exactly the false conclusion
**D3** forbids, and it made an earlier waiter report "no review requested" against
reviews that had already been delivered.

**The only sound signal is the review itself, scoped to the commit** — nothing has to
be "requested" for that to become true, and nothing being there yet does not mean
nothing was requested. Absence is never a verdict.

### Check Whether Copilot Has Reviewed the Current Head

This is the real check. Note the `commit_id` scoping — without it you learn only that
Copilot reviewed *something*, which says nothing about the code in front of you:

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')          # or set it explicitly: PR_NUMBER=123
REPO_NWO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')

# Reviews of the CURRENT head — this is coverage.
gh api "/repos/${REPO_NWO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/reviews" \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login | startswith(\"copilot-pull-request-reviewer\")) | select(.commit_id == \"${HEAD_SHA}\") | {state, submitted_at}]"

# Every Copilot review with its commit — diagnostic, to see whether a review exists
# but covers an older commit. NOT a pass signal.
gh api "/repos/${REPO_NWO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/reviews" \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | startswith("copilot-pull-request-reviewer")) | {commit_id, state, submitted_at}]'
```

Or via GraphQL — include `commit { oid }`, otherwise the result is unscoped and
cannot answer the question:

```bash
# Replace OWNER, REPO, PR_NUMBER with actual values. `-f query='...'` is single-quoted,
# so nothing inside it is shell-expanded — these are literal substitutions, not shell
# variables. The `$head` in the --jq below is a *jq* variable and stays as written.
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      headRefOid
      reviews(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          author { login }
          state
          submittedAt
          commit { oid }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest | .headRefOid as $head | [.reviews.nodes[] | select(.author.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer") | {state, submittedAt, oid: .commit.oid, covers_head: (.commit.oid == $head)}]'
```

**Prefer `copilot-review` over any of the above.** It wraps the request and a
head-SHA-aware wait, and it prints the review body so the verdict headline — which
no thread query surfaces — can be read.

### Full Copilot Review Status Summary

Query all Copilot-related information in one call. Note there is deliberately **no
`reviewRequests` node**: it is always empty for the Copilot bot (**D1**), so including
it only invites the "no request → nobody asked" misreading. `headRefOid` and
`commit { oid }` are what make the result answerable.

```bash
# Replace OWNER, REPO, PR_NUMBER with actual values (GraphQL body — no shell expansion here)
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "REPO") {
    pullRequest(number: PR_NUMBER) {
      headRefOid
      reviews(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          author { login }
          state
          submittedAt
          commit { oid }
        }
      }
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        totalCount
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              author { login }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Then filter for Copilot status:

```bash
# Reviews covering the CURRENT head — the only pass signal
jq '.data.repository.pullRequest | .headRefOid as $head | [.reviews.nodes[] | select(.author.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer" and .commit.oid == $head)]'

# All Copilot reviews with their commits — diagnostic only, NOT a pass signal
jq '.data.repository.pullRequest | .headRefOid as $head | [.reviews.nodes[] | select(.author.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer") | {state, oid: .commit.oid, covers_head: (.commit.oid == $head)}]'

# Unresolved Copilot threads
jq '[.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false and .comments.nodes[0].author.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer")] | length'
```

### Status Interpretation

Every row keys off a **delivered review and its commit**. No row keys off a review
*request*: that field is always empty (**D1**), so any rule reading it fires its
negative branch on every PR (**D3**).

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Review whose `commit_id` == the PR's `headRefOid` | Review completed **for the code you are about to merge**. Read its verdict headline (**D4**) |
| Review exists, but its `commit_id` is an older commit | **Current head is UNREVIEWED.** Nudge, then wait via `copilot-review` — do not treat this as reviewed |
| No Copilot review at all | **Nothing has reviewed this PR yet.** Wait via `copilot-review`. This is not "clean", and it is *not* evidence that no review was requested — you cannot determine that at all (**D1**) |
| Unresolved threads with Copilot author | Feedback needs attention |
| Zero unresolved threads | Clean **once** a review covers the current head — on an older commit it says nothing about the code being merged |
| `reviewRequests` / `requested_reviewers` empty | **Means nothing.** It is always empty. Do not derive any status from it (**D1**) |

3. **Update this skill**
   - Read `references/known-issues.md`
   - Add the new issue using the provided template
   - Include both the failed approach and working solution
   - Explain the root cause

4. **Update SKILL.md if needed**
   - If it's a common pattern, add brief guidance to SKILL.md
   - Link to the detailed documentation in references files

### Self-Improvement Example

**Problem encountered:**
```bash
gh pr edit 13 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
$(cat /tmp/pr-body.md)
EOF
)"
# Result: Literal string "$(cat /tmp/pr-body.md)" in PR description
```

**Solution found:**
```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/13 -X PATCH -F body=@/tmp/pr-body.md
# Result: PR description correctly updated
```

**Documentation added to references/known-issues.md:**
- Failed approach with explanation
- Working approach with example
- Root cause analysis
- Alternative solutions

This ensures the same mistake is never repeated.

## Best Practices

1. **Read references before complex operations** - Check if the pattern is already documented
2. **Verify all changes** - Always confirm `gh` commands had the intended effect
3. **Use GraphQL for data queries** - More powerful than chaining CLI commands
4. **Document new solutions** - Update `references/known-issues.md` when encountering new problems
5. **Prefer `-F` over `-f` for file inputs** - Use `@filename` syntax for reliable file reading
