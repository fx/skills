# Review — Shared Reviewer Procedure

> **Path note:** `[SKILLS_DIR]` below is the directory holding this skill's own folder —
> the parent of the directory containing this `SKILL.md`. Substitute its absolute path;
> every skill referenced below is installed as a sibling there.

**The one procedure every reviewer in this catalog follows.** The platform skills —
`codex-review`, `coderabbit-review`, `copilot-review`, `pr-reviewer`,
`resolve-pr-feedback`, `copilot-feedback-resolver`, `rabbit-feedback-resolver` —
are adapters. They describe how to drive one particular tool: its command, its
flags and quirks, the shape of its output, the threads or checks it exposes.
Everything else — what to review, what to report, what to fix, when to stop —
lives here and is identical for all of them.

**Load order:** this skill first, then the platform skill. A platform skill that
contradicts this one is stale; this one wins, and the contradiction is a bug to
report.

## Why this skill exists

Seven skills once carried their own copy of these rules. A copy drifts the moment
the original changes, and a stale copy is reliably the *narrower* one — so it
under-blocks, under-converges, or re-opens scope it should not. That is not a
hypothetical: the divergence was found and fixed repeatedly before the rules were
brought here.
This skill is the application of `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md`
§ Blocking's define-once rule to the review skills themselves.

## The two canonical sources

| Source | Holds |
|---|---|
| `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md` | **Definitions.** The Scope Brief, the materiality bar, what *blocking* means, the three filters, resolver dispositions, convergence, the iteration bound, fix-the-class. |
| **This skill** | **Procedure.** How a reviewer applies those definitions, in order, from first pass to final report. |

Neither restates the other. Where this skill needs a definition it names the
section; where a platform skill needs either, it names them rather than copying.

**One exception, and only one: text sent verbatim to an external tool.** A prompt
handed to `codex review` or any reviewer outside this repo cannot follow a
link, so it MUST inline the rule. Such a block is a **mirror**: mark it as one,
keep it a faithful restatement, and update it in the same commit that changes the
canonical text. Nothing an agent reads directly qualifies — only strings crossing
a process boundary.

---

## Step 1: Carry the Scope Brief

**Never review a bare diff.** A reviewer that does not know what was asked for
reports the work that was deliberately not done — missing implementation for a
docs-only change, missing tests for a spec, dependencies a later phase adds. Each
such finding costs a full review cycle to filter by hand.

Every review invocation MUST carry the **Scope Brief**
(`[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md` § The Scope Brief for the
definition and field rules; § Injecting the brief into reviews for how it reaches
each kind of reviewer).

- **Handed one by a coordinator** — use it verbatim. Do not summarise it.
- **Invoked without one** — reconstruct it from the conversation and the PR
  description before reviewing, **and say in your report that you did**.

**The brief never suppresses a real finding.** It excludes work deliberately not
done; it does not excuse defects in the work that *was* done. Security, privacy,
data-loss and correctness problems inside the change are always in scope, whatever
the brief says. An excluded finding re-enters scope only on the two conditions in
§ Three filters, filter 1 — and being merely correct is not one of them.

## Step 2: Triage in the contract's order

**Scope, then contract, then materiality** — the three filters, in that order
(`[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md` § Three filters). Applying them
out of order produces the wrong verdict:

1. **Scope** — an out-of-scope finding is **deferred** with the exclusion that
   covers it, however material it looks in isolation.
2. **Contract** — a violation of a project rule, a security or privacy
   invariant, **or any other mandatory requirement the project wrote down**,
   including a change document or a spec it links, is **blocking by virtue of
   being a rule**. It never reaches the bar, so "it changes no behaviour" cannot
   demote it. The full definition is § Three filters, filter 2; do not read this
   summary as narrower than it.
3. **Materiality** — everything left is ranked by the bar.

A reviewer's own severity labels — CodeRabbit's `🧹 Nitpick` / `🔵 Trivial`,
Copilot's `[nitpick]` prefix, a `P2` — are an **input** to that judgment, never a
verdict. A label demotes nothing: an item carrying one still goes through all
three filters, so a project-rule, security or privacy violation wearing a
`[nitpick]` prefix is a contract blocker at filter 2 regardless. Nor does the
converse hold — calling something a correctness defect does not carry it past the
bar. A false count nobody acts on reaches filter 3 and ranks immaterial, exactly
as § The bar says.

The outcome is exactly one of: **blocking**, **immaterial**, **deferred**, or —
where you checked the premise and it does not hold — **no disposition at all**
(§ Resolver dispositions). Blocking is defined once, in § Blocking; this skill
does not restate it.

### Three things that are not findings

Per § Three things that are not findings, and not narrowed here:

- **An entry missing from a list the artifact does not present as exhaustive** —
  "for example" counts, not just an explicit declaration. Not reported at all, not
  even in the closing note: the supply never runs out, so a note listing them
  grows without bound. Assess whether the *rule* is right instead.
- **A decision the artifact records with its rationale, where your disagreement is
  about preference** — say so once as an escalation; do not re-argue it next pass.
  This never applies when the decision is itself the defect.
- **A limit the artifact admits and gates** — check the gate is real and sequenced
  before the thing that depends on it, then move on.

## Step 3: Verify the premise before acting

A finding's premise can be wrong. When one rests on a claim about the tree, check
it. Where it does not hold:

- **Reviewing** — reject the finding with the evidence, and put it in the next
  pass's do-not-re-report list.
- **Resolving threads** — the thread is a false positive, not a finding. It gets
  **no disposition**; hand it to the outdated/incorrect handler with the reason.
  If the `blocking` disposition came from a coordinator, do **not** close the
  thread on your own reading — that disposition is authoritative. Return it for
  reclassification and leave it open.

Fixing a phantom finding is worse than leaving it: it changes working artifacts to
satisfy a misreading, and a suggestion applied on sight has been observed to
introduce the very bug it claimed to report.

## Step 4: Fix the class, not the instance

**The single biggest cause of a review loop that will not end.** A reviewer
reports the instance it happened to read; fix exactly that instance and the next
pass finds a sibling and reports it as new. Every pass is productive and the loop
still never terminates.

Follow `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md` § Fix the class, not the
instance in full — the sibling axes (lexical, altitude, symmetry, enumeration),
the requirement to prove the sweep with a search whose empty result is the
evidence, and the rule that scope still bounds the sweep.

Two practical points that cost real cycles here:

- **Normalise whitespace before searching for anything longer than a few words**,
  and never filter out the file under review. Both have produced an empty result
  that was read as proof while the phrase sat there wrapped across a newline.
- **Do not start the next pass with a class half-closed.** A re-run against a
  partial fix spends a full cycle being told about siblings you already knew
  about, and its findings are indistinguishable from new ones.

When a finding is one instance of a pattern **you can see elsewhere**, report it
as ONE finding naming the class and list every other site — § Reporting a class.

## Step 5: Act on the disposition

| Disposition | Action |
|---|---|
| **blocking** | Fix it, swept as a class, and push (or commit, for a local review). A contract blocker is never discharged by a reply explaining it — the artifact has to change. |
| **blocking, annotated `already fixed in <sha>`** | The same disposition, already discharged by the coordinator's batched push — handle it exactly as § Resolver dispositions says, which is reply-and-resolve with no edit. |
| **immaterial** | **Reply with the reasoning** — what the observation is, why it is below the bar — and resolve. **No edit.** For a local review with no threads, it goes in the closing note instead. |
| **deferred** | Reply citing the exclusion that covers it, and resolve. **No edit, and no commit** — including no tracker commit, which widens the change. Return the follow-up to the coordinator, or propose it to the user when running standalone. |

**A false premise is not a fourth disposition.** There are exactly three
(§ Resolver dispositions), and a thread whose premise does not hold carries
**none** of them — that absence is what routes it to the adapter's
outdated/incorrect handler: reply with the evidence, resolve, and where a
deliberate convention was misread, record it (Step 6). A coordinator hands it over
as an explicitly undisposed item *with the reason*, never as a disposition value,
because an authoritative one would close that route off and lose the `REVIEW.md`
entry with it.

**Never edit for an immaterial finding.** Every push requires another reviewer
pass before the loop can converge, so actioning one manufactures the next round's
input — it is the churn the materiality bar exists to stop. The gate is zero
*unresolved* threads, not zero observations acted on.

**A disposition assigned by the coordinator is authoritative** and overrides a
resolver's own categorisation (§ Resolver dispositions): the coordinator holds the
brief and the ledger, and a resolver classifying from comment text alone does not.

## Step 6: Record incorrect findings in `REVIEW.md`

When a reviewer flags a pattern that is a deliberate project convention, write the
rule into **`REVIEW.md` at the repo root**. One entry stops Codex, Copilot,
CodeRabbit and Claude Code Review from raising it again — they all resolve to that
file.

That entry is **required work, not an edit made for an immaterial finding**: it is
the only thing that stops the false positive recurring, and its commit is expected.

- **Never** create or edit `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. It is obsolete.
- If `REVIEW.md` does not exist, create just that file, with a `# PR Review`
  heading and the rule under it. **Do not run `fx-setup` or `fx-upgrade`
  from a review** — they scaffold `docs/`, `AGENTS.md` and `.coderabbit.yaml`, and
  burying one review rule in a large unrelated diff is not an acceptable change.
  Mention that `/fx-setup` completes the layout later.
- **Keep the top section under 4000 characters.** Copilot reads roughly the first
  4000 when reviewing, and `REVIEW.md` is pasted verbatim into Claude Code
  Review's prompt, where length dilutes the rules that matter. Put the most
  important rules in a `## PR Review Checklist (CRITICAL)` section at the top.
- `REVIEW.md` is pasted verbatim: `@` imports are not expanded and referenced
  files are not read. Write the rule out in full; never write `See docs/…`.

### Parallel resolvers must not write it concurrently

Re-reading before writing is not locking: two sub-agents can read the same
revision and the second write silently discards the first's rule. When resolvers
run in parallel, have each **return** its proposed rules instead of editing, then
apply them all in one serialized edit and verify with `git diff -- REVIEW.md` that
every proposed rule appears as an added line. Counting the whole file always fails
— an established `REVIEW.md` already holds unrelated rules.

## Step 7: Re-run until it converges

**Convergence is the goal.** Repeat Steps 1–6 until **no blocking finding is left
unresolved** — the ledger test in `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md`
§ Convergence, and the only test.

**Converged does NOT mean zero output.** Waiting for silence spends full cycles on
wording. And do not re-derive the test from materiality: it already settles both
edge cases, so trust it rather than rebuilding it. A deferred finding is
non-blocking however material it looks in isolation; a contract blocker is
blocking however small its behavioural impact.

Note the test is *unresolved*, not *new*: a blocker carried from an earlier pass
still blocks even if this pass did not repeat it, so a thread count on the current
pass is not the whole ledger. Track them and clear the list.

### Carry the settled ground into each re-run

Each pass must know what the last one decided, or it re-derives it. Carry forward,
in the prompt for a CLI reviewer and in your own working notes otherwise:

- the same Scope Brief, plus anything newly established;
- **each prior outcome separately** — fixed, immaterial, deferred, false premise.
  A summary saying "all fixed except the rejected ones" describes neither an
  immaterial item nor a deferred one, so the reviewer is told they disappeared and
  raises them again stripped of their reasoning;
- the classes closed since the last pass, **with the search that proved each
  closed**, so the pass is spent on ground nobody has covered.

A rejection holds only **while its reason still holds**. Each was made against a
particular state of the tree, and later fixes change that tree — if a fix removed
what made a finding a false positive, it is valid now. Report it as new and say
which fix invalidated the rejection.

### The two exits, and one signal that is not one

- **Converged** — no blocking finding left unresolved. The only successful exit.
- **The same disagreement in successive passes** — a human decision, not a review
  outcome. Escalate it **by name** and stop; do not spend the remaining iterations
  re-arguing it.
- **A rising blocking count in one class** — the last fix is generating them.
  **Not an exit:** stop fixing instances, fix the cause, and keep looping, so the
  root fix is itself reviewed. It ends the loop only where that cause is a design
  choice with two defensible answers, which is an escalation to the user. A count
  rising across *different* categories means the review is still productive, not
  diverging.

Every loop caps at the bound in § The iteration bound, which counts the initial
pass as iteration 1 and which no skill restates or overrides. **The bound is a
runaway backstop, not a target.** Reaching it is a failure to converge that you
report as an escalation, never as a pass. Each pass on a real branch takes many
minutes, so fix causes, not instances.

## Step 8: Report

State the shape, not a verdict, so the operator can see it rather than take
"clean" on trust:

- **The per-pass trend of blocking findings** — *"Findings per pass: 9, 4, 1, 0
  blocking."*
- **What remains below the bar**, as one closing note, unnumbered and explicitly
  non-blocking. Never a numbered finding, never a reason for another pass.
- **What was deferred**, with the exclusion covering each.
- **Whether the last round's fixes were themselves reviewed.** If you stopped
  after applying fixes nothing has reviewed, say so.
- **Counts per tier.** A review that reports twenty things equally has reported
  nothing.
- **Whether you reconstructed the Scope Brief** rather than being handed one.

**For a reviewer that receives the brief** — Codex, a sub-agent — a run
producing **zero** out-of-scope findings is the signal it was well built, and
persistent out-of-scope noise means it is too thin: tighten it before the next
iteration rather than filtering by hand again.

**For one that cannot receive it** — Copilot, the CodeRabbit GitHub App — that
signal does not exist. Their out-of-scope output is independent of how good the
brief is, so rewriting it changes nothing and tightening it in response is a loop
that does not converge. Judge those runs on **triage coverage** instead: every
out-of-scope item was recognised as such and deferred with the exclusion that
covers it, none silently fixed and none silently dropped.

---

## The external-reviewer block

**One reviewer reads a string rather than this file: `codex review`, via its
prompt.** It cannot follow a link, so it needs the rules inlined — the one case
§ The two canonical sources exempts. There is **one** such block, here, and the
Codex adapter sends this text rather than writing its own.

(Copilot and the CodeRabbit GitHub App accept no prompt at all, so the brief
reaches them only at triage — see `fx-review` Step 8.)

> **This block is a MIRROR** of `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/scope-contract.md`
> § Blocking, § Reporting a class, and § Three things that are not findings. Keep
> it a faithful restatement, never an independent edit, and update it in the same
> commit that changes the canonical text.

**The block has two parts, and they are sent on different schedules.** Do not read
"send it verbatim on every pass" as covering both: Part 1 is addressed to a
reviewer that has prior passes to be told about, and on pass 1 it degenerates into
`Prior passes found <count> issues` with nothing to fill in.

- **Part 1 — the convergence prefix. From pass 2 only.** Omit it entirely on
  pass 1; there is nothing to carry yet.
- **Part 2 — the bar. Every pass, pass 1 included, verbatim.** Pass 1 is where a
  reviewer with no bar produces the largest crop of low-value findings, so
  omitting it there costs the most.

On a re-run, send Part 1 followed by Part 2. On pass 1, send Part 2 alone.

**Part 1 — the convergence prefix (pass 2 onwards):**

```
CONVERGENCE PASS <N>. Prior passes found <count> issues, disposed of as follows
— give each list, not a total, because an item summarised as "fixed" that was not
comes back without its reasoning:
- fixed and pushed: <the blocking ones>
- immaterial, deliberately not actioned: <item, and why it is below the bar>
- deferred as out of scope: <item, and the exclusion that covers it>
- rejected as a false premise: <item, and what did not hold>

Do not re-report any of them **while the reason still holds** —
each was rejected against a specific state of the tree, and later fixes have
changed that tree. If one of those reasons no longer holds, report the finding as
new and say which fix invalidated the rejection. Do not treat a rejection as
permanent.

Classes closed since the last pass — every site of each was swept, not just the
one reported: <class, and the search that proved it closed>. Report a further
instance of one of these only if the sweep actually missed it, and say which
site.
```

**Part 2 — the bar (every pass, including pass 1):**

```
Report every BLOCKING finding. A finding is blocking if it is any of:

1. A violation of a rule this project wrote down — anything in AGENTS.md or
   REVIEW.md, a security or privacy invariant, or any other mandatory
   requirement the project recorded, including a change document or a spec it
   links. Report these whatever their direct behavioural impact; the project
   already decided they matter, so do not weigh them against the bar below.
2. Something that would change behaviour, break a build, a CI check or a test,
   make the artifact unimplementable, or expose a security, privacy, or data-loss problem
   — including a leaked credential, internal URL, or private identifier in
   documentation or examples. A false statement counts when a reader would act
   on it; a wrong number nothing keys on does not.
3. A genuine ambiguity a reader could act on two ways, or a missing step that
   would be discovered late and cost a cycle.

Wording, formatting, and counts nothing keys on are NOT blocking: one closing
note, not findings. The exception is item 1 above — where the project wrote down
a rule about wording or formatting, violating it is blocking on those grounds,
and this sentence does not override that.

When a finding is one instance of a pattern that appears elsewhere, say so and
list every other site you can see. Report it as ONE finding naming the class,
not as one finding per site and not as a single site. A class reported whole is
fixed in one pass; a class reported one instance at a time takes as many passes
as it has members.

Where this artifact marks a list as open — it says "for example", or it declares
the list illustrative and the rule authoritative — assess the RULE. A further
missing list entry is not a finding, and it does not belong in the closing note
either: do not report it at all. The supply never runs out, so a note listing them
grows without bound.

Where the artifact admits a limit and gates it — "verified by X at
implementation time", "open question gated on Y" — that is a disposition, not a
gap. Check the gate is real and sequenced before the thing that depends on it,
and do not report the limit itself as a missing step.

Where it records a decision with its rationale — including "unknown, gated on
X" — and your disagreement is about preference, that is settled: say so once as
an escalation, and do not re-argue it. This does NOT cover a decision that is
itself the defect. If the decision leaks a credential, an internal URL, or a
private identifier, loses data, violates a security or privacy invariant, or
contradicts a contract the project mandates — a spec, a change document, or a
written project rule — report it as a blocking finding however carefully it is
reasoned.

If the artifact is internally consistent and matches the tree, say so plainly.
```

## What a platform skill adds

Only what is true of that tool and nothing else:

- how to invoke it, and the flags, exit codes and failure modes that matter;
- how its output is shaped, and how to extract findings from it;
- the threads, checks or gates it exposes, and how to settle them;
- its authentication and availability rules, and its degradation path.

**A platform skill MUST NOT restate Steps 1–8.** If it needs one, it names the
step. If it genuinely needs different behaviour, change it here, for everyone.

## Shared rules that bite in every platform

- **Never leave new PR-level comments.** `gh pr review --comment` and
  `gh pr comment` are forbidden, as is any GraphQL mutation creating a new review
  or PR-level comment, and any interaction with a human reviewer's threads. The
  only permitted operations are replying to an existing *bot* thread with
  `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` and resolving it with `resolveReviewThread`.
- **Never run an interactive auth command** — not `codex login`, not
  `gh auth login`. The workspace is expected to be authenticated; if it is not,
  STOP and report it to the user.
- **Absence of feedback is not evidence of quality.** A reviewer that has not run,
  a poll that saw nothing, and a timeout are all *unreviewed*, not clean.
- **Resolution is not the same as a fix.** A thread ends resolved either way; only
  a blocking finding requires the artifact to change.

## When to use this skill directly

Reviewing code with no particular tool in mind — a diff, a branch, a spec. Then
this skill is the whole procedure, and there is no adapter to load.
