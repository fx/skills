# Dev — SDLC Workflow Skill

This skill defines the **mandatory** workflow for one explicitly invoked `/dev` lifecycle. Follow its steps in order for that lifecycle; do not infer or auto-start it from an ordinary coding request.

## Invocation Boundary (CRITICAL)

- Start this lifecycle only when the user explicitly invokes `/dev`, names `dev`, or directly asks to use the dev lifecycle.
- Do not load it merely because a request involves coding, implementation, GitHub, planning, review, or a phrase that resembles one of its stages.
- Its authority covers the lifecycle request through the Step 8 handoff. Once that handoff is complete, later user messages are standalone requests unless the user explicitly invokes `/dev` again.
- Incidental questions and operations are not new lifecycle stages. Handle status checks, branch synchronization, PR metadata edits, and an explicitly authorized merge directly when they require no substantive implementation judgment.
- A user may explicitly narrow, waive, or stop a procedural pass. Mandatory correctness, security, privacy, and merge-gate requirements remain in force, but the skill must not argue that its own orchestration mechanics outrank a direct user instruction.

## CRITICAL RULES

**Delegate the substantive roles this lifecycle owns — requirements analysis, planning, implementation, and independent review — each to its own sub-agent that loads the matching skill. Do not delegate a mechanical operation the coordinator can perform directly.**

### How to Launch Sub-Agents with Skills

A delegate is defined by four things, whatever your host calls them:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| handle | A short addressable name, so it can be messaged and its report attributed |
| tier | `large` / `medium` / `small`, per the size table below |
| skill | The skill it loads **before** doing anything else |
| prompt | The task, plus the Scope Brief verbatim |

In Claude Code that renders as:

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the [skill-name] skill (Skill tool: skill='[skill-name]'), then:
           [task details]"
  description: "[3-5 word summary]"
  model: "[per the size table below]"
```

Every example in this document uses that syntax. **Read it as the operation, not the only spelling** — `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/host-adapters.md` maps all seven operations this skill assumes onto Claude Code and Codex, and is where a new host gets added.

**A skill is not an agent type.** Delegates are general-purpose; the skill is loaded *inside* the delegate, by its prompt. In Claude Code specifically, do not put a skill name in `subagent_type` — that parameter selects built-in agent types (`Explore`, `Plan`) and will not find a skill.

#### Pick an agent SIZE for every spawn

Choose by the **shape of the task**, not by how important it feels. Every Agent template in this document omits the model for brevity; supply it from here on every call.

| Size | Use for |
|---|---|
| **large** | Implementation (Step 4). Planning (Step 3). Requirements analysis (Step 2). Independent review. Fix agents on an **undiagnosed** failure. Anything requiring design judgment. |
| **medium** | PR preparation. Browser/test-plan verification. Fix agents handed an **exact, specified** patch. Mechanical work with a clear spec. |
| **small** | Pure inspection or summarisation with no judgment call. |

**Request the tier, not a model name.** "Spawn a large-model sub-agent" resolves to whatever the host currently offers at that tier, so this table does not go stale every time a model ships — and a hardcoded name silently becomes wrong rather than failing loudly. Where the host requires an explicit model, map the tier to its general-purpose **coding** models and nothing else; a model specialised for another domain is the wrong choice at every tier regardless of its size. In Claude Code that means the three coding tiers only — **never select `fable`.**

**Never downgrade an implementation or review agent.** Those are judgment-heavy, and a weaker agent that needs more iterations costs *more* than a stronger one that needs fewer — turn count, not per-turn price, dominates. A downgrade that adds two review rounds is a large net loss that looks like a saving.

Two constraints worth knowing rather than rediscovering:

- **Tier and reasoning effort are different dials, and not every host exposes both.** Where effort is settable per spawn (Codex), raise it too for the judgment-heavy roles, not just the tier. Where it is not (Claude Code, which inherits it from the session), the tier is the only lever you have — do not expect a `large` delegate to think harder merely because the task is hard.
- **The smallest tier may carry a reduced context ceiling.** For read-heavy roles that is a feature: it bounds context growth for free. Check your host's limit in `[SKILLS_DIR]/dev/references/host-adapters.md` rather than assuming.

`team` carries the same table for its coordinator spawns; keep the two in step.

### Coder Task Reporting (Sub-Agent Restriction)

**Where a task-reporting integration is configured** — e.g. the Coder dashboard's `mcp__coder__coder_report_task` — **sub-agents MUST NEVER send "idle" or "complete".** Only the root session reports those; a delegate may report `"state": "working"` and nothing else. Skip this entirely if no such integration exists. This prevents sub-agents from overwriting the coordinator's dashboard status and falsely signaling task completion.

- ❌ NEVER author repository implementation code or documentation yourself
- ❌ NEVER create implementation commits yourself
- ❌ NEVER skip tests (`test.skip`, `it.skip`, `describe.skip` are FORBIDDEN)
- ❌ NEVER select a skill as an agent type — the delegate loads it from its prompt (in Claude Code: not via `subagent_type`)
- ✅ ALWAYS delegate requirements analysis, planning, implementation, and independent review roles
- ✅ ALWAYS instruct delegated role agents to load their named skills via the Skill tool
- ✅ ALWAYS perform straightforward status checks, branch synchronization, PR metadata updates, and an explicitly approved merge directly when delegation adds no independent judgment
- ✅ ALWAYS verify each lifecycle gate before proceeding, except where the user explicitly waives a procedural pass that is not a mandatory correctness, security, privacy, test, or merge gate
- ✅ ALWAYS fix, replace, refactor, or remove tests - never skip them
- ✅ ALWAYS carry the Scope Brief (Step 2.5) verbatim into every delegated lifecycle role and reviewer call

**FAILURE TO DELEGATE A SUBSTANTIVE LIFECYCLE ROLE = WORKFLOW FAILURE. Spawning a sub-agent for a mechanical coordinator operation is also a workflow failure.**

### Scope Discipline (STOP rule)

**When the work outgrows the request, stop and tell the user.** Do not silently
deliver more than was asked. Full rule and calibration:
`references/scope-contract.md`.

Stop when you discover the task needs materially more than its own framing
implies: subsystems the user never named, a migration or breaking change, several
PRs where one was implied, or an architectural decision the user has not made.
Report in two or three sentences — what you found, why it exceeds the request,
the cheapest path forward — offer the narrow option first, and wait. Deliver
everything unambiguously in scope first; never stop with nothing done.

The threshold moves with the Scope Brief's size signal: a `narrow` request stops
at any overrun, `normal` stops at an unmade decision or a reach beyond the named
subsystem, `open-ended` stops only at architectural forks or irreversible actions.

**Do NOT stop for work inside the request's natural boundary:** tests for code you
just wrote, docs the change invalidates, fixing a build you broke, following an
approved change document to completion, or resolving findings classified
`required-by-contract` / `regression-caused-by-change`. Over-triggering is its own
failure mode.

### Test Policy

**⛔ NEVER skip tests.** If a test cannot pass:
- **Fix it** - Update assertions to match correct behavior
- **Replace it** - Write a new test that properly validates the behavior
- **Refactor it** - Restructure to test what's actually testable
- **Remove it** - Delete entirely if it tests something that no longer exists

If tests require infrastructure (auth, database, external services), SET UP that infrastructure. Do not skip tests because setup is hard.

---

## MANDATORY STEPS (Execute in Order)

### STEP 0: GitHub Authentication

**Execute FIRST before anything else.**

```bash
gh auth status
```

If fails: STOP. Tell user to run `gh auth login`. Do NOT proceed.

---

### STEP 1: Workspace Preparation

**Create clean feature branch BEFORE any implementation.**

#### 1.1 Check for uncommitted changes

```bash
git status
```

If uncommitted changes exist:
- Ask user: "Uncommitted changes found. Stash them or abort?"
- If stash: `git stash push -m "SDLC auto-stash"`
- If abort: STOP

#### 1.2 Sync and create branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
```

Branch types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until branch is created**

---

### STEP 2: Requirements Analysis

**MANDATORY: Launch a sub-agent that loads the requirements-analyzer skill.**

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the requirements-analyzer skill (Skill tool: skill='requirements-analyzer'), then:

           Analyze requirements for: [TASK DESCRIPTION]

           - Analyze task/issue/error to understand requirements
           - Use WebSearch to research technologies
           - Use WebFetch for referenced URLs
           - Use AskUserQuestion for ambiguities
           - Analyze codebase for patterns

           Output: Complete requirements with acceptance criteria"
  description: "Analyze requirements"
```

For GitHub issues, fetch first:
```bash
gh issue view [NUMBER] --json title,body,labels,comments
```

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until requirements are complete**

---

### STEP 2.5: Freeze the Scope Brief and Implementation Contract, and Open the Finding Ledger

**First, build the Scope Brief.** It is the user's own framing, and it must
survive every sub-agent hop and every reviewer call. Full definition and field
rules: `references/scope-contract.md` (beside this skill).

```markdown
### Scope Brief
- **Verbatim request:** "<the user's exact words, quoted, never paraphrased>"
- **Interpreted scope:** <files, subsystems, deliverable>
- **Deliverable type:** <docs | code | spec | research | config | mixed>
- **Explicitly out of scope:** <what must NOT be touched or flagged, with reasons>
- **Size signal:** <narrow | normal | open-ended>
- **Known-and-accepted:** <deliberate states a reviewer would otherwise flag>
```

Derive **size signal** from the user's own language: "just", "real quick",
"only", "small", "minimal" → `narrow`; "thoroughly", "comprehensive", "audit",
"properly" → `open-ended`; otherwise `normal`. A `narrow` request is a budget,
not filler — honour it.

**The Scope Brief MUST be included verbatim in every downstream sub-agent prompt
and every reviewer invocation in Steps 3, 4, 4.5, 6, and 8.** A reviewer without
it reports the work you deliberately did not do, and every such finding costs a
full review cycle to filter by hand.

**Then freeze the implementation contract.** If the task is sourced from, names, or discovers a relevant `docs/changes/*.md` file, read it and the spec sections it links. Confirm implementation approval from the conversation or the change's recorded workflow state; if approval is unclear, STOP and ask the user. Record the contract path and approval evidence in the working brief. The change document, its linked specs, and all mandatory project rules form the implementation contract: the plan and coder prompt MUST map work to that contract and MUST NOT infer adjacent product or architecture work.

The coordinator owns one in-memory finding ledger for the run; reviewer sub-agents return findings to the coordinator and MUST NOT mutate the ledger concurrently. Give every finding a stable fingerprint (`category + file + line/range + normalized claim`) and record its source, first-seen revision, classification, materiality tier, disposition, and verification evidence. Classification and materiality are independent fields — see Step 4.5 for how the tier is assigned. The tier is `n/a` for a contract blocker: filter 2 stops before the bar, so a rule violation is never ranked, and inventing a tier for one is the mistake that lets it be argued down. Classify each finding exactly once as:

- **required-by-contract** — Necessary to satisfy the change document, its linked specs, or any mandatory project, security, privacy, test, or merge rule.
- **regression-caused-by-change** — A demonstrable correctness, security, privacy, or data-loss regression caused by this branch anywhere within its behavioral impact, including downstream consumers or integrations.
- **follow-up/out-of-scope** — A pre-existing issue, hardening, cleanup, product addition, architecture expansion, or improvement not required by either category above.

Fix the first two classes, and any entry that is blocking by tier — a reviewer-originated Material or Substantive finding blocks even where no written rule names it (`references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking). Deduplicate repeated or reworded findings by fingerprint and update the existing ledger entry. Record every **non-blocking** entry for the PR or later tracking without implementing it — `follow-up/out-of-scope` at tier `n/a` or `immaterial`. An entry of that class that blocks by tier is fixed like any other blocker; the class name never decides remediation. When reviewer resolvers are invoked by `/dev`, their deferred-feedback paths MUST return follow-ups to the coordinator instead of modifying task trackers in the implementation PR. To implement out-of-scope product or architecture work, first amend the change document and obtain user approval.

---

### STEP 3: Planning

**MANDATORY: Launch a sub-agent that loads the planner skill.**

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the planner skill (Skill tool: skill='planner'), then:

           [PASTE THE STEP 2.5 SCOPE BRIEF VERBATIM HERE]

           Create implementation plan for:

           [REQUIREMENTS FROM STEP 2]

           - Keep the plan inside the Scope Brief; if the work cannot be done
             within it, stop and report that rather than planning around it
           - Break into atomic steps
           - Identify files to modify
           - Determine test requirements
           - Flag if multiple PRs needed
           - Treat the approved change document as the implementation contract
           - Do not include non-blocking follow-up/out-of-scope work, or expand product/architecture, without an approved amendment

           Output: Numbered implementation steps"
  description: "Plan implementation"
```

For GitHub issues, also update issue:
```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the issue-updater skill (Skill tool: skill='issue-updater'), then:

           Update issue #[NUMBER] with plan. Add label: in-progress"
  description: "Update issue"
```

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until plan exists**

---

### STEP 4: Implementation

**MANDATORY: Launch a sub-agent that loads the coder skill.**

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the coder skill (Skill tool: skill='coder'), then:

           [PASTE THE STEP 2.5 SCOPE BRIEF VERBATIM HERE]

           Implement this plan:

           [PLAN FROM STEP 3]

           Requirements:
           - Stay inside the Scope Brief; if implementation cannot be completed
             within it, stop and report rather than widening the change
           - Atomic commits (format: type(scope): message)
           - Follow existing patterns
           - Run tests
           - Treat the approved change document as the implementation contract
           - Do not implement non-blocking findings, or expand product/architecture, without an approved amendment (an entry blocking by tier is fixed whatever its class)
           - Do NOT create PR"
  description: "Implement changes"
```

Verify commits exist:
```bash
git log --oneline -5
git diff main --stat
```

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until commits exist on feature branch**

---

### STEP 4.5: Pre-PR Self-Review (simplify → review → Codex)

**MANDATORY: Run one complete local review matrix before creating the PR.** Run each available pass once in order against the current `HEAD`, record the revision that each channel reviewed, and classify its findings before accepting fixes. If `/simplify` edits directly, retain only changes that satisfy the contract classification and record the resulting revision before starting the next pass.

**Every pass below follows `fx-review`** — the canonical review procedure
(Skill tool: `skill="fx-review"`), which each reviewer skill loads first. This
step does not restate it. In particular: **every pass MUST receive the Step 2.5
Scope Brief verbatim**, and a pass run without it is incomplete — rerun it with
the brief rather than filtering its output.

**1. `/simplify`** — reuse, quality, efficiency cleanup:

```
Skill tool: skill="simplify", args="<Scope Brief>"
```

Reviews changed code for **reuse** (duplicated logic), **quality** (copy-paste, leaky abstractions, nesting), and **efficiency** (redundant computation, missed concurrency).

**2. `/code-review`** — correctness bugs in the diff:

```
Skill tool: skill="code-review", args="<Scope Brief>"
```

**3. Codex (local, via `codex`)** — independent one-shot branch review:

```
Skill tool: skill="codex-review", args="<Scope Brief>"
```

**Codex is the ONLY local reviewer.** There is no local CodeRabbit pass — the `cr` CLI is not used anywhere in this SDLC. CodeRabbit applies only at the PR level in Step 6.3, and only when the repo's GitHub App is installed.

The Codex CLI takes the scope as its review prompt, so this pass is the one where a missing brief is most expensive — it will confidently report every deliberate omission. If the `codex` CLI is unavailable or not authenticated, report it once and proceed without this pass. NEVER run `codex login`.

#### Remediation and Delta Verification

**Record each finding's class, not just its location** (`references/scope-contract.md` § Fix the class, not the instance). A reviewer reports the instance it read; the ledger entry names the defect pattern and every site in the change's surface that exhibits it, so a fix closes the class rather than buying the next cycle its input. A ledger entry is not resolved while a sibling of its class is open, and a reviewer MUST NOT be re-run with a class half-closed.

Fix every **blocking** ledger entry (`references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking): everything classified `required-by-contract` or `regression-caused-by-change`, plus any entry blocking by tier — a reviewer-originated Material or Substantive finding blocks even where no written rule names it. After a fix commit:

1. Rerun the reviewer or check that originated the blocking finding.
2. Rerun tests affected by the delta.
3. Rerun another reviewer only when the delta touches the risk area that reviewer covered or invalidates its recorded evidence.

Do not restart the full matrix merely because `HEAD` changed. Deduplicate repeated or reworded findings against the ledger; they do not start a new cycle. When `/dev` invokes reviewer subskills, this contract classification and bounded stopping policy takes precedence over generic instructions to resolve every actionable finding or rerun until clean.

**The materiality bar applies to judgment-originated findings only** — things a reviewer raised on its own reading, rather than violations of a rule the project wrote down (`references/scope-contract.md`). One of those must clear the bar before it can be treated as blocking. Materiality is a **separate ledger field**, not a fourth classification — every entry still carries exactly one of the three classifications above, plus a materiality tier. An observation that would change nothing if it shipped uncorrected is recorded as `follow-up/out-of-scope` with materiality `immaterial`, and never triggers a rerun.

**Rule violations are blocking regardless of materiality.** Anything Step 2.5 defines as `required-by-contract` — project, security, privacy, test and merge rules the project wrote down — is blocking by virtue of being a rule, whatever its direct behavioural impact. The contract filter runs before the bar, exactly as `references/scope-contract.md` § Three filters specifies, so the coordinator can never demote a violation the reviewer correctly marked blocking. Two shapes in particular are non-findings and MUST NOT enter the ledger **at all**, at any tier — not as blocking, and not as an immaterial entry either: a missing entry in a list the artifact does not present as exhaustive, whether it says "for example" or declares the list illustrative, and a decision the artifact records with its rationale **where the disagreement is about preference**. Recording them as immaterial keeps the churn and merely renames it. The second, raised again in the very next pass, is an escalation to the user rather than a third cycle (`references/scope-contract.md` § Convergence defines that trigger) — but a recorded rationale never makes a decision safe. The full carve-out is in `references/scope-contract.md` § Three things that are not findings and is not narrowed here: if the decision itself leaks a credential or private identifier, loses data, violates a security or privacy invariant, **or contradicts a contract the project mandates**, it is `required-by-contract` and stays blocking.

#### PR-Ready Stopping Condition

Proceed to Step 5 when all of the following are true:

1. Every **blocking** ledger entry is resolved with evidence. Blocking is defined once, in `references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking; this gate does not restate it.

   **A finding excluded at filter 1 can never carry a Material or Substantive tier.** The two fields are assigned by different filters and cannot disagree, so that one pair is illegal. Note the rule is about the *filter*, not the class name: `follow-up/out-of-scope` holds entries of two different origins, and all three tiers can be legal for it — a finding excluded at filter 1 never reaches the bar, so its tier is `n/a`; an in-scope observation that reached filter 3 and failed it is tier `immaterial`. A finding that reaches the bar at all is one no written rule covers — a written-rule violation stops at filter 2, unranked, as a contract blocker with tier `n/a` and class `required-by-contract`, and never reaches filter 3. So a finding ranked Material or Substantive is in scope by construction, is a defect in work this change actually did, and is *not* `required-by-contract`: it is `regression-caused-by-change` where the branch caused a regression, and otherwise — a two-way ambiguity in something this change wrote, say — it stays in this class and **still blocks, by tier**. The classification answers what obliges the fix; the tier answers whether it blocks, exactly as the stopping condition below states. What is illegal is that tier pair on a finding excluded at filter 1, which never reached the bar. **The filter outcome decides the resolver disposition — not the class name, and not the tier** (§ Resolver dispositions). Tier `n/a` is carried by two unrelated outcomes and so cannot pick one: a contract blocker is `n/a` because filter 2 stopped before the bar, and it is **blocking** — fixed and pushed; a finding excluded at filter 1 is `n/a` because it never reached the bar, and it is **deferred**, replied to with the exclusion. Tier `immaterial` settles as `immaterial`, replying with the materiality reasoning. Read the outcome, never the tier alone. Citing an exclusion for an in-scope observation invents one that does not exist. If you are about to record that pair, one of the two filters was misapplied — re-run them rather than writing an entry the gate can neither clear nor waive. Materiality never promotes an out-of-scope finding back into scope (`references/scope-contract.md` § Three filters); this rule is that principle applied to the ledger.
2. Contract-required tests and tests affected by the latest delta pass.
3. Every available review channel completed its initial pass or has a documented permitted degradation.
4. The review has **converged** as `references/scope-contract.md` § Convergence defines it — no blocking finding left unresolved, ledger-wide, not merely none new in the latest pass. As an additional gate, that state is confirmed by one verification pass over the latest affected delta.

`follow-up/out-of-scope` entries with tier `n/a` — the class and the tier together, which is what identifies a filter-1 exclusion — and immaterial observations, do not block PR creation. Tier `n/a` alone does not qualify: a `required-by-contract` entry carries it too, and blocks. Nothing else is waivable here: a reviewer-originated Material or Substantive finding blocks even though no written requirement names it, exactly as item 1 above and `references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking say. Each review channel caps at the single bound defined in `references/scope-contract.md` § The iteration bound, which counts the initial pass as iteration 1 and which no skill restates or overrides — count reviewer invocations in total, not remediation rounds on top of the first pass. **Convergence is the goal, and the bound is a runaway backstop, not a target.** Reaching it means the loop failed to converge; report it that way. Reaching the bound is a failure to converge and does not authorize Step 5. STOP, report the per-pass trend and everything still open, and let the user decide whether to create the PR — including when every remaining entry is `follow-up/out-of-scope` with tier `n/a`. A blocking entry at the bound is always an escalation; the bound never waives one. A contract amendment may change product scope, but it cannot waive mandatory correctness, security, privacy, testing, or merge rules.

**Do not spend the headroom.** The bound is far above what a healthy channel needs; the signals that should actually end a loop — converged, and the same disagreement in successive passes (`references/scope-contract.md` § Convergence) — fire in single digits, as does a rising blocking count of one class, which is a cause to fix rather than an exit: address the cause and continue, and escalate only where the cause is a design choice with two defensible answers (`references/scope-contract.md` § The iteration bound). A round that resolves only immaterial items is churn at any iteration number, and the convergence rule already forbids it.

### STEP 5: Pull Request Creation

**MANDATORY: Prepare the PR directly from the coordinator, optionally loading `pr-preparer` in the coordinator session. Do not spawn a sub-agent solely to push a branch or create/edit PR metadata. ALL PRs MUST be created READY FOR REVIEW — never as drafts.**

**⛔ NEVER use the `--draft` flag. NEVER create draft PRs.** Draft PRs have repeatedly been used as an excuse to skip downstream steps (reviewer waits, CI monitoring, CodeRabbit/Copilot resolution). The SDLC ALWAYS executes the full review/CI cycle from PR creation onward — opening as draft defeats this. If the work isn't ready for review, don't open the PR yet.

**Before creating the PR, identify related spec and change documents:**

```bash
# Find related change documents (check if task was sourced from a change doc)
ls docs/changes/ 2>/dev/null
# Find related specs
ls docs/specs/ 2>/dev/null
cat docs/index.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If the work was driven by a specific change document or spec, note the paths for inclusion in the PR description.

```
Skill tool: skill="pr-preparer", args="
           Create PR (ready for review, NOT draft) for current branch.
           Task: [ORIGINAL TASK]
           Summary: [WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED]

           Spec/Change context (include in PR body if applicable):
           - Spec: [SPEC_PATH or 'none']
           - Change: [CHANGE_DOC_PATH or 'none']

           CRITICAL: Do NOT pass --draft. The PR must be opened ready for review so
           CI, Copilot, and CodeRabbit run from the start.
           - Push branch if needed
           - Create PR with: gh pr create  (NO --draft flag)
           - Include links to related spec/change docs in the PR body
             (use relative paths from repo root, e.g. docs/specs/auth/ or docs/changes/0003-add-oauth.md)
           - Do NOT put spec/change references in the PR title — not as a number,
             slug, or path, even when the PR finalizes a change doc. Describe the
             work itself in the title; reference the doc by path in the body only.
           - ⛔ NEVER put '#<number>' in the PR title ('#4', '(#4)', '#123')
             unless N is a REAL existing PR/issue on the target repo that this PR
             references. On squash-merge the title becomes the commit subject,
             where '#N' auto-links to PR/issue #N. NEVER use '#N' for an
             implementation wave, phase, step, or change-doc number, and NEVER
             pre-add a '(#N)' suffix (GitHub appends the real PR number at squash
             merge). No waves/phases/steps in the title at all — those go in the
             body. See the github skill's '#<number> PR-Title Rule'.
           - Reference related issues
           - Do NOT include any 'this is a draft' / 'draft for review' language
             anywhere in the title or body
           - Return PR number and URL"
```

**Capture the PR number for remaining steps.**

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until PR is created (as ready for review)**

---

### STEP 5.5: Test Plan Verification (MANDATORY)

**This step is MANDATORY for every PR that has a test plan.** It is NOT limited to web/UI changes. Backend changes, platform integrations, CLI tools, and infrastructure changes all have test plans that must be addressed.

#### 5.5.1 Extract and Classify the Test Plan

Read the PR description and extract the Test Plan section:

```bash
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json body --jq '.body'
```

Parse the `## Test plan` section. Each `- [ ]` item is a verification target.

If the PR has no Test Plan section, construct one from the PR diff — identify what changed and create verification steps. Add them to the PR description before proceeding.

**Classify each test plan item into one of three categories:**

| Category | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Browser-verifiable** | Can be tested via Playwright MCP (UI routes, visual changes, interactions) | Run verify-web-change (Step 5.5.2) |
| **Programmatically verifiable** | Can be tested via CLI, API calls, log inspection, or automated scripts | Run verification commands directly (Step 5.5.3) |
| **Manual-only** | Requires external systems, user accounts, or physical interaction (e.g., "send a Discord message", "check email") | Annotate for user and prompt them to verify (Step 5.5.4) |

#### 5.5.2 Browser Verification (for browser-verifiable items)

**Skip this sub-step if no test plan items are browser-verifiable.**

Detect if browser verification is possible:

```bash
WEB_FILES=$(git diff main --name-only | grep -E '\.(tsx|jsx|vue|svelte|html|css|scss|less)$' || true)

HAS_WEB_STACK=false
for cfg in vite.config.ts vite.config.js next.config.js next.config.ts next.config.mjs nuxt.config.ts svelte.config.js angular.json astro.config.mjs; do
    if [[ -f "$cfg" ]]; then
        HAS_WEB_STACK=true
        break
    fi
done
```

If web changes exist and browser-verifiable items are present, launch the verify-web-change sub-agent:

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the verify-web-change skill (Skill tool: skill='verify-web-change'), then:

           Verify the following Test Plan items for PR #[PR_NUMBER] using browser automation:

           [BROWSER-VERIFIABLE TEST PLAN ITEMS]

           For each item:
           1. Navigate to the relevant page/route
           2. Use Playwright MCP snapshots to verify the element/behavior exists
           3. Test any interactions described in the test plan item
           4. Check for console errors
           5. Report PASS/FAIL per item with evidence (what you observed)

           Output: A list of each test plan item with its result (PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED) and evidence."
  description: "Verify web changes in browser"
```

#### 5.5.3 Programmatic Verification (for programmatically verifiable items)

**Skip this sub-step if no test plan items are programmatically verifiable.**

For items that can be verified via commands (API calls, log inspection, test runs, etc.), run the verification directly:

- Check test output: `bun --bun run test` — confirm relevant tests pass
- Inspect logs: Check dev server output for expected behavior
- Call APIs: Use `curl` or similar to verify endpoint behavior
- Check database state: Verify schema/data changes applied correctly

Record PASS/FAIL per item with evidence.

#### 5.5.4 Manual Verification (for manual-only items)

**⛔ NEVER silently skip manual-only test plan items.**

For items that require manual interaction (external services, physical devices, user accounts), you MUST:

1. **Tell the user** which items require their manual verification
2. **Explain what to test** — be specific about the steps
3. **Ask them to confirm** each item passes or fails
4. **Wait for their response** before proceeding

Example:
```
The following test plan items require manual verification:
- [ ] Send a message to the Discord bot and verify the typing indicator appears immediately
- [ ] Confirm the typing indicator stays active for responses > 10 seconds

Please test these and let me know the results.
```

#### 5.5.5 Update the Test Plan in the PR Description

**MANDATORY: After all verification (automated + manual), update the PR description.**

```bash
BODY=$(gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json body --jq '.body')
```

For each Test Plan item:
- **Verified (pass)**: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- **Verified (fail)**: Leave as `- [ ]` and append: `— FAILED: [reason]`
- **Manual — confirmed by user**: Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` and append: `(manually verified)`
- **Manual — not yet verified**: Leave as `- [ ]` and append: `— requires manual testing`

Update the PR:

```bash
gh pr edit [PR_NUMBER] --body "$UPDATED_BODY"
```

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED to Step 6 until every test plan item has been addressed** — either verified (pass/fail), confirmed by user, or explicitly annotated as requiring manual testing.

#### 5.5.6 Handle Failures

If any Test Plan items failed verification:
1. Launch a sub-agent with the coder skill to fix:
   ```
   Agent tool:
     prompt: "Load the coder skill (Skill tool: skill='coder'), then:

              Fix these verification failures:
              [FAILURE DETAILS]
              Push fixes to the PR branch."
     description: "Fix verification failures"
   ```
2. After fixes are pushed, re-run the relevant verification step (5.5.2 or 5.5.3)
3. **Maximum 2 fix iterations.** If still failing after 2 attempts, proceed to Step 6 and note the unverified items in the PR description.

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until verification passes or max iterations reached**

---

### STEP 6: Review & Quality

**MANDATORY: Execute ALL sub-steps.**

#### 6.1 Self-Review

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the pr-reviewer skill (Skill tool: skill='pr-reviewer'), then:

           [PASTE THE STEP 2.5 SCOPE BRIEF VERBATIM HERE — the reviewer must
            know what was asked for before it reads the diff, and must report
            out-of-scope findings as deferred rather than blocking]

           Review PR #[NUMBER] for:
           - Code quality
           - Test coverage
           - Security issues
           - Performance

           Output: Issues found (if any), each marked in-scope or deferred"
  description: "Review PR"
```

The coordinator MUST classify and deduplicate these findings in the Step 2.5 ledger before invoking a coder. Pass every **blocking** entry to implementation and nothing else (`references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking) — which includes a `follow-up/out-of-scope` entry blocking by tier, and excludes an entry that is not blocking. Select on blocking, never on the tier: `n/a` marks a contract blocker (filter 2 stopped before the bar) just as it marks a filter-1 exclusion, so dropping every `n/a` entry drops every mandatory rule violation.

#### 6.2 Fix Blocking Issues (if any found)

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the coder skill (Skill tool: skill='coder'), then:

           Fix only these blocking issues in PR #[NUMBER]:
           [EVERY BLOCKING LEDGER ENTRY — REQUIRED-BY-CONTRACT,
            REGRESSION-CAUSED-BY-CHANGE, AND ANY ENTRY BLOCKING BY TIER]

           Do not implement ledger entries that are not blocking. Judge that by
           the blocking flag, not the tier: a required-by-contract entry also
           carries tier n/a, and it MUST be fixed."
  description: "Fix review issues"
```

#### 6.3 Automated Reviewer Wait (Copilot + CodeRabbit + future)

**MANDATORY: Wait for and resolve EVERY automated reviewer configured on the repo.** Copilot and CodeRabbit are the two we know about today; future integrations slot in here. Reviewers are **independent feedback channels** with different latencies (Copilot 85 s to 12 m 42 s observed — do not budget for it being quick; CodeRabbit 2–10+ min and re-runs after every push).

> **CodeRabbit is PR-level only.** There is no local CodeRabbit pass — Step 4.5 runs Codex alone. CodeRabbit applies here when the repo's GitHub App auto-reviews PRs, and its waiter reports `STATUS=NOT_CONFIGURED` when it does not, which is the common case and is terminal. Prefer a passing check and resolve received feedback; if CodeRabbit rate-limits, resolve what it already delivered — blocking findings fixed, every posted thread settled — then record `skipped (rate-limited)` and continue without blocking.

##### Reviewer-by-reviewer skills

| Reviewer | Skill | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot-review` | Auto-reviews; we explicitly request via API as a defensive belt. Does NOT re-review on push by default. |
| CodeRabbit | `coderabbit-review` | PR-level only — there is no local pass. Applies when the GitHub App auto-reviews PRs: re-reviews after pushes and exposes state via the `CodeRabbit` check. Classify new feedback in the shared ledger and settle its threads within the bounds below. `STATUS=NOT_CONFIGURED` means the App is absent — report once and skip. |

##### Run every waiter in the background — there is no mode selection

**⛔ Launch each configured reviewer's wait script concurrently, each redirecting to its own log file.** Take the shape of the wait from `references/host-adapters.md` § Long waits — on Claude Code it is one message with every call `run_in_background: true`, woken per reviewer by its completion notification, and spawning sub-agents for the wait buys nothing; on Codex the same table says to delegate each waiter to a teammate and `wait_agent` on it. Either way the concurrency is the same and there is no "can I spawn sub-agents?" branch to agonise over: root session, `team` coordinator, and sub-agent all follow their host's row. **Where the row makes each waiter a child, those children spend the host's concurrency slots** — Codex has three for teammates, so two reviewers plus the Step 7 CI wait already fill a wave. Launch them in batches of at most three and reconcile between batches; a spawn past the limit queues, and a queued waiter looks exactly like a hung one.
```bash
# Both in ONE message, both run_in_background: true
mkdir -p [AGENT_DIR]/team/waits && \
bash [SKILLS_DIR]/copilot-review/scripts/wait-for-copilot-review.sh [PR_NUMBER] \
     > [AGENT_DIR]/team/waits/copilot-[PR_NUMBER].log 2>&1

mkdir -p [AGENT_DIR]/team/waits && \
bash [SKILLS_DIR]/coderabbit-review/scripts/wait-for-coderabbit-review.sh [PR_NUMBER] \
     > [AGENT_DIR]/team/waits/rabbit-[PR_NUMBER].log 2>&1
```

**Never run a waiter in a call that cannot outlive it.** On Claude Code that means never in the foreground: the Bash tool caps a foreground `timeout` at 600 000 ms, below every waiter's 900 s budget, so the call is killed mid-poll, printing no STATUS and no exit code, and the caller then re-runs it blindly. Every host has some equivalent ceiling — Codex yields `exec_command` after 30 s — which is why `references/host-adapters.md` § Long waits gives each one a shape that survives the budget. **Never launch one without the redirect**: the cycle is driven by what the script prints.

###### Then, per reviewer, on its wake

1. Read the log and branch on its `STATUS=` line (each reviewer skill documents its own table; the five states are shared):
   - `TERMINAL_PASS` / `TERMINAL_FAIL` — settled. Do **not** re-run for a better answer.
   - `PENDING` — not a verdict and not a failure. Re-running is safe if you still need it. **Never** record it as "no findings" or "CI passed".
   - `NOT_CONFIGURED` — that reviewer does not apply to this repo. Terminal: report once, proceed without it, never retry.
   - `ERROR` — the wait never started. Report it.
2. Read its unresolved threads and classify them in the shared ledger **before** invoking any resolver. Neither Copilot nor the CodeRabbit GitHub App accepts a scope prompt, so the brief cannot reach them — you apply it at triage.
3. Invoke each reviewer's resolver only after classification, passing the blocking findings and a disposition for every thread that carries a finding — `blocking`, `immaterial`, or `deferred` (`references/scope-contract.md` § Resolver dispositions) — so it settles both no-edit dispositions without code or task-tracker changes. A thread whose premise you verified and rejected is listed as undisposed with the reason, not forced into one of the three.
4. After a resolver pushes, record the new SHA and inspect only feedback added or changed since the previous reviewed SHA. Classify and deduplicate it in the shared ledger. Relaunch only the waiter whose state or evidence the delta invalidated; do not restart every reviewer merely because `HEAD` changed.
5. Stop when the channel has **converged** per `references/scope-contract.md` § Convergence — no blocking finding left unresolved, ledger-wide — confirmed by one latest-delta pass, and every required reviewer thread is settled.

Never let a reviewer's findings reach an implementer before you have classified them.

##### Bounded delta review

Fix every **blocking** finding and only those (`references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking), whatever its ledger class. Record the non-blocking remainder without implementing it, and settle its thread with the disposition that actually fits (`references/scope-contract.md` § Resolver dispositions): `deferred` — citing the exclusion — for a finding excluded by scope, and `immaterial` — replying with the materiality reasoning — for an in-scope observation that fails the bar. Both are no-edit, and they are not interchangeable: citing a scope exclusion for an in-scope observation invents an exclusion that does not exist. Each reviewer channel caps at the canonical bound in `references/scope-contract.md` § The iteration bound, which counts the initial pass as iteration 1 and which no local instruction restates or overrides. Convergence, not the bound, is what should end it: the early signals (converged, and the same disagreement in successive passes, both per `references/scope-contract.md` § Convergence) fire in single digits, as does a rising blocking count of one class — which is a cause to fix and continue, not an exit, and an escalation only where that cause is a design choice. Reaching the bound is a failure to converge, not an exit you may take: STOP, report the per-pass trend and what remains, and hand the decision to the user. Do not advance to the next workflow step on the strength of having hit it, even when only follow-up/out-of-scope entries remain. Do not seek zero suggestions or restart unrelated review channels.

##### Skip rules

- If a reviewer is **not configured** for the repo (its waiter reports `STATUS=NOT_CONFIGURED` — e.g. no `CodeRabbit` check ever appears), report this once and proceed without that reviewer. That status is terminal: never retry or wait it out.
- If **CodeRabbit reports a rate/quota limit or cooldown**, report it once, mark CodeRabbit `skipped (rate-limited)`, and proceed immediately. Do not raise timeouts, sleep, poll, or retry for CodeRabbit throttling. **The degradation waives only the review passes that never ran** (`coderabbit-review`, rate-limit rule): anything CodeRabbit already delivered still counts — fix its blocking findings and settle every thread it already posted before recording the skip, or the PR carries an open thread past a gate that requires none.
- Do not apply this exception to Copilot or other reviewers. A merely slow CodeRabbit check with no rate-limit signal still follows the normal timeout behavior.

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until every required reviewer has settled. CodeRabbit is satisfied by a passing result, or by an explicit `skipped (rate-limited)` degradation once everything it already delivered is resolved.**

---

### STEP 7: CI/CD Monitoring

**MANDATORY: Execute ALL sub-steps. Maximum 3 fix iterations.**

Because Step 5 opens the PR ready for review (NOT draft), CI workflows that
trigger on `pull_request` start immediately. There is no draft → ready
transition to manage in this workflow.

#### 7.1 Wait for CI Checks to Start and Complete

**⛔ Run the bundled CI check script as a long wait** — `references/host-adapters.md` § Long waits — redirecting to a log file and reading that log on the wake. On Claude Code that is `run_in_background: true` plus the completion notification:

```bash
mkdir -p [AGENT_DIR]/team/waits && \
bash [SKILLS_DIR]/dev/scripts/wait-for-ci-checks.sh [PR_NUMBER] \
     > [AGENT_DIR]/team/waits/ci-[PR_NUMBER].log 2>&1
```

**Do NOT run it in a call that cannot outlive it.** On Claude Code the Bash tool caps a foreground `timeout` at 600 000 ms, below the script's 900 s budget, so a foreground call is killed mid-poll and the output is lost; backgrounded processes are not subject to that cap. **Never launch it without the redirect**: the workflow reacts to what the script prints.

Script behavior:
- Phase 1 (discovery): waits up to 90 s for any check to appear.
- Phase 2: polls every 30 s until all checks settle, against a shared 900 s wall-clock budget.

Branch on the trailing `STATUS=` line:

| STATUS | Exit | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `TERMINAL_PASS` | 0 | Every check completed, none failed → **proceed to Step 8** |
| `TERMINAL_FAIL` | 1 | Every check completed, at least one failed → **proceed to Step 7.2** |
| `PENDING` | 2 | Still running at budget expiry. Not a verdict. Re-run to keep waiting, or report the wait as unfinished. **Never** record it as "CI passed". |
| `NOT_CONFIGURED` | 3 | No checks appeared within the discovery grace — this PR has no CI configured. **This is NOT a pass**: a merge gate requiring green CI is not satisfied by the absence of CI. Report it and confirm against branch protection. |
| `ERROR` | 4 | Bad arguments, `gh` unauthenticated, or the checks API could not be read → report. A failed read is not "no checks". |

#### 7.2 Handle CI Failures (LOOP — max 3 iterations)

**If Step 7.1 reports `STATUS=TERMINAL_FAIL` (failures detected):**

```
Skill tool: skill="resolve-ci-failures"
```

Pass the failure details from the script output to the skill. The skill will:
1. Analyze failure logs and identify root causes
2. Delegate fixes to a sub-agent with the coder skill
3. Push the fixes

**After the skill completes and fixes are pushed, GO BACK TO Step 7.1** — re-run the wait script to monitor the new check run. This creates a loop:

```
Step 7.1 (wait) → fail → Step 7.2 (fix) → Step 7.1 (wait) → ...
```

**⚠️ Maximum 3 iterations.** Track the current iteration count. If checks still fail after 3 fix attempts, STOP and report the persistent failures to the user with full details.

**⛔ DO NOT PROCEED until all checks pass or max iterations reached**

---

### STEP 8: Finalization

#### 8.1 Final Verification (MANDATORY MERGE GATES)

**⛔ ALL of the following must be verified before ANY PR can be merged. No exceptions.**

```bash
# 1. CI checks — ALL must be green (includes the CodeRabbit check)
gh pr checks [NUMBER]

# 2. Automated reviewers — MUST be settled and resolved (if not already done in Step 6.3)
# Reuse Step 6.3 evidence when it covers the current head SHA. Invoke a dedicated
# reviewer skill only when its check, threads, or reviewed SHA changed; do not restart
# a settled review loop solely because finalization was reached.
# Use the dedicated skills — NEVER raw gh api commands.
```
```
Skill tool: skill="copilot-review",     args="[NUMBER] — [STEP 2.5 SCOPE BRIEF VERBATIM]"
Skill tool: skill="coderabbit-review",  args="[NUMBER] — [STEP 2.5 SCOPE BRIEF VERBATIM]"
```
```bash
# 3. Unresolved review threads — MUST be 0 (across ALL reviewers)
gh pr view [NUMBER] --json reviewThreads \
  --jq '[.reviewThreads[] | select(.isResolved == false)] | length'

# 4. Codecov — patch and project checks must pass
gh pr checks [NUMBER]  # verify codecov/patch and codecov/project
```

-->

**Merge gate checklist (every item must pass):**
- [ ] PR is open and mergeable
- [ ] **PR title is a conventional-commit subject** (`type(scope): description`) — verify `gh pr view [NUMBER] --json title -q .title | grep -Eq '^(feat|fix|docs|refactor|chore|test|perf|build|ci|style|revert)(\(.+\))?!?: .+'`; a plain prose title FAILS — rename with `gh pr edit [NUMBER] --title "type(scope): …"` BEFORE merging (squash bakes the title into `main`). Also no stray `#<number>`/wave/phase wording.
- [ ] ALL CI checks green
- [ ] Copilot review RECEIVED and ALL threads resolved (via `copilot-review` skill — NEVER raw `gh api`)
- [ ] CodeRabbit is passing with all received threads resolved, not configured, or explicitly recorded as `skipped (rate-limited)`. CodeRabbit throttling is optional and never blocks merge.
- [ ] Zero unresolved **blocking** ledger entries (`references/scope-contract.md` § Blocking) — `required-by-contract`, `regression-caused-by-change`, and any entry blocking by tier; the latest affected delta is verified within the stopping bounds
- [ ] Codecov coverage passing with 0 missing lines
- [ ] No unresolved review threads from any reviewer (Copilot, CodeRabbit, human, or future automated reviewer); follow-up/out-of-scope threads are settled without expanding implementation

duvet# The size, triviality, or follow-up status of a pull request MUST NOT be treated as grounds for waiving any merge gate.
-->

**PR size is NEVER a reason to skip merge gates.** A 1-line fix gets the same verification as a 1000-line feature.

The PR was opened ready-for-review in Step 5, so there is no draft → ready
transition to perform here. Do NOT run `gh pr ready` — it is unnecessary and
will fail on a non-draft PR.

#### 8.2 Update Task Tracking Docs

**MANDATORY: Mark completed tasks in the relevant change document or tasks file.**

If a change document or task list was referenced in the original request (e.g., a `docs/changes/NNNN-name.md` or `docs/tasks.md`), use it directly. If none was provided, search for the relevant tracking doc:

```bash
# Look for change documents or tasks that reference the work being done
grep -rl "keyword from task" docs/changes/ docs/tasks.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

Once identified, update the doc to mark completed tasks:
- Check off completed items (e.g., `- [ ]` → `- [x]`)
- Add the PR number: `- [x] Task name (PR #N)`
- Only mark items that are **actually addressed by the changes in this PR**
- If ALL tasks in a change document are now complete, update its Status to `complete`
- Commit the doc update to the PR branch

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the coder skill (Skill tool: skill='coder'), then:

           Update task tracking in [DOC_PATH]:
           - Read the doc and identify tasks completed by PR #[NUMBER]
           - Mark those tasks as done: - [x] Task name (PR #N)
           - Do NOT mark tasks that were not addressed
           - If all tasks in a change doc are done, update Status: complete
           - SYNC INDEXES: Update docs/index.yml (status field) and docs/index.md (table row) to match
           - Commit the change with: docs: mark completed tasks in [DOC_NAME]
           - Push to the PR branch"
  description: "Update task tracking"
```

If no relevant tracking doc is found, skip this step.

#### 8.3 Update Issue (if applicable)

```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the issue-updater skill (Skill tool: skill='issue-updater'), then:

           Update issue #[NUMBER]: Link PR, set label ready-for-review"
  description: "Update issue"
```

#### 8.4 Report to User

```
✅ PR #[NUMBER] ready: [URL]

Changes:
- [summary bullets]

Awaiting your approval to merge.
```

<!--
duvet= docs/specs/fx-dev-authority/index.md#dev-runs-require-user-approval-before-merge

duvet# A `dev` run MUST obtain explicit approval from the user before merging any pull request it produced.
-->

**⚠️ NEVER MERGE WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**
**⚠️ NEVER MERGE WITHOUT ALL MERGE GATES PASSING (Step 8.1)**
**⚠️ NEVER MERGE WITHOUT COPILOT REVIEW RECEIVED AND ADDRESSED**

After this handoff, a later user message such as "merge it" is a standalone mechanical request, not a new `/dev` phase. Recheck the live gates and merge directly in the coordinator session. Do not re-invoke `/dev`, reload its internal skills, or spawn a merge sub-agent.

## Workflow Variations

### GitHub Issue URL

1. STEP 0: Auth check
2. STEP 1: Branch as `fix/issue-123-description`
3. Fetch issue: `gh issue view [NUMBER] --json title,body,labels,comments`
4. STEP 2-8: Standard (use issue-updater in Steps 3 and 8)

### Quick Fix (fix:, error:, bug: prefix)

1. STEP 0: Auth check
2. STEP 1: Branch as `fix/short-error-desc`
3. STEP 2: Focus on error analysis, root cause
4. STEPS 3-8: Standard

### Multi-PR Tasks

1. Complete STEPS 1-8 for first PR
2. **STOP** - Wait for user approval
3. Only after approval: Start next PR
4. Track with TodoWrite

**NEVER have multiple PRs open simultaneously**

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Sub-agent fails | Retry once with adjusted params, then STOP and report |
| Git conflict | STOP, report to user, wait for resolution |
| Tests fail | coder sub-agent fixes, rerun until pass |
| Auth fails | STOP, request `gh auth login` |

---

## Sub-Agent Quick Reference

All sub-agents are launched via the Agent tool. Each loads its skill via the Skill tool inside the sub-agent.

| Step | Skill to Load | Skill Name |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 2 | Requirements Analyzer | `requirements-analyzer` |
| 3 | Planner | `planner` |
| 3,8 | Issue Updater | `issue-updater` |
| 4,6.2,8.2 | Coder | `coder` |
| 4.5 | Pre-PR Self-Review | `simplify`, then `code-review`, then `codex-review` (local `codex`, the ONLY local reviewer) — initial passes complete, blocking findings resolved, latest affected delta verified |
| 5 | PR Preparer | `pr-preparer` |
| 5.5.2 | Browser Verification | `verify-web-change` |
| 6.1 | PR Reviewer | `pr-reviewer` |
| 6.3 | Copilot Review | `copilot-review` (waiter backgrounded, concurrent with coderabbit-review) |
| 6.3 | CodeRabbit Review | `coderabbit-review` (PR-level only, waiter backgrounded, concurrent with copilot-review; classify/deduplicate feedback and verify only affected deltas within bounds) |
| 6.3 | PR Feedback Resolver | `resolve-pr-feedback` (meta — called by reviewer skills) |
| 7.2 | CI Failure Resolver | `resolve-ci-failures` |

**Pattern for every sub-agent call:**
```
Agent tool:
  prompt: "Load the [skill-name] skill (Skill tool: skill='[full-skill-name]'), then: [task]"
  description: "[summary]"
```

---
