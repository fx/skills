# The Scope Contract

Canonical definition of the **Scope Brief**, the **materiality bar**, and the **sprawl stop rule**. All three are mandatory across the workflow and review skills in this catalog.

This document holds the **definitions**. The **procedure** that applies them — how a reviewer carries the brief, triages, sweeps a class, converges and reports — is the `fx-review` skill, which every reviewer and feedback resolver loads first. Neither restates the other.

Three failures motivate this document:

1. **Reviewers flagging work nobody asked for.** A reviewer handed a bare diff has no idea what was requested. It reports missing implementation for a docs-only change, missing tests for a spec, or absent dependencies that a later phase adds. Every one of those is noise the operator must hand-filter, and each round of noise costs a full review cycle.
2. **Reviewers never finishing.** A review loop that treats every observation as a finding does not converge: each pass fixes what the last one raised and surfaces a fresh crop of smaller ones. The findings get less important, the passes keep costing the same, and the loop ends only when someone gives up. Scope answers *what to review*; materiality answers *what is worth reporting and when to stop*.
3. **Work quietly outgrowing the request.** A user says "just fix the typo real quick" and gets a refactor. The user's own phrasing is the scope signal, and it is routinely discarded the moment the first sub-agent is launched.

The first and third have the same root cause: the user's original words stop travelling. The Scope Brief makes them travel. The second needs its own rule, below.

## The Scope Brief

Build it **once**, as early as possible — the first skill to act on a user request owns its construction — and thread it verbatim through every downstream sub-agent, skill invocation, and reviewer call.

```markdown
### Scope Brief

- **Verbatim request:** "<the user's own words, quoted exactly>"
- **Interpreted scope:** <what that concretely means: files, subsystems, deliverable>
- **Deliverable type:** <docs | code | spec | research | config | mixed>
- **Explicitly out of scope:** <what must NOT be touched, changed, or flagged>
- **Size signal:** <narrow | normal | open-ended>
- **Known-and-accepted:** <deliberate states a reviewer would otherwise flag>
```

### Field rules

**Verbatim request** — quote, never paraphrase. "just do X real quick" and "implement X" are different instructions and must not collapse into the same summary. If the request spans several messages, quote each. If the user restated or narrowed it mid-run, the narrowed version wins and the earlier one is noted.

**Interpreted scope** — the inference you are acting on, stated plainly so the user can catch a wrong reading in your first report rather than in the final diff.

**Explicitly out of scope** — the highest-value field for reviewers. Anything deliberately not done: phases deferred to later work, files intentionally left stale, dependencies a later change adds, implementation a spec-only change does not include. Without this list a reviewer will rediscover each one as a finding.

**Size signal** — derive from the user's own language:

| Signal | Phrases |
|--------|---------|
| `narrow` | "just", "real quick", "only", "small", "quick fix", "one-liner", "don't overthink", "minimal" |
| `open-ended` | "thoroughly", "comprehensive", "audit", "deep dive", "properly", "refactor", "whatever it takes" |
| `normal` | anything else |

**Known-and-accepted** — deliberate states that look like defects out of context: a failing test tracked elsewhere, a TODO the user asked to leave, an old API kept for compatibility.

## Injecting the brief into reviews

**Every review invocation MUST carry the Scope Brief.** This applies to `fx-review` and every adapter over it — `codex-review`, `coderabbit-review`, `copilot-review`, `resolve-pr-feedback` and the two feedback resolvers — and to any other reviewer a user invokes directly over the same change.

**The reviewers this catalog *drives* are Codex, Copilot and CodeRabbit, and no others.** Codex runs locally before the PR; Copilot and CodeRabbit — the latter only where its GitHub App is installed — run on the PR. No workflow here runs a Claude-side review pass: `/code-review`, `/simplify`, and reviewing sub-agents are not lifecycle gates. A user can still invoke them by hand, and when they do, the brief applies to them too.

**That is a rule about what to *request*, not about whose threads to settle.** A repo may have other reviewers configured that these skills never invoke. Their threads still gate the merge — `docs/specs/fx-dev-authority/index.md` § Unresolved Reviewer Threads Gate Every Merge requires that no thread from *any* configured automated reviewer be left open under a merge, and that requirement is not narrowed by this roster. Triage and settle whatever arrives; just do not add a reviewer pass of your own.

**Settling a reviewer this catalog has no adapter for is done by hand, and there is a route.** There is a waiter and a resolver for Copilot and for CodeRabbit only, so a third reviewer's threads reach no resolver: the coordinator triages them against the brief exactly as it does Copilot's (which accepts no prompt either), replies with the disposition, and resolves the thread with the `resolveReviewThread` mutation documented in `github`. **`resolve-pr-feedback` reporting zero unresolved threads is not evidence for such a reviewer** — it categorises by author login and re-queries automated reviewers it knows, so a third bot's threads are outside what its verdict covers. Check them directly before claiming the gate is met, and if the thread cannot be settled, that is an escalation to the user, never a merge.

- **Skills that accept arguments** — pass the brief as the argument.
- **CLI reviewers that accept a prompt** — pass an OUT OF SCOPE / IN SCOPE prompt built from the brief.
- **Reviewers that accept nothing** (Copilot, CodeRabbit's GitHub App) — the brief cannot reach them. Apply it when **triaging** their findings: an out-of-scope finding is recorded and dismissed with a reason, not fixed.

Translate the brief into reviewer-facing sections:

```
OUT OF SCOPE — do NOT report any of these:
- <each "explicitly out of scope" item, with the reason it is deliberate>
- <each "known-and-accepted" item>
- Anything about files not in this change.

IN SCOPE — review for:
- <what the change is actually meant to accomplish>
- <the quality dimensions that matter for this deliverable type>
```

State the **reason** each exclusion is deliberate. "Do not flag missing tests" invites the reviewer to override you. "This change is spec-only; implementation and its tests are task 2 of change 0007" does not.

**A reviewer invoked without a brief MUST reconstruct one** from the conversation before reviewing, and say that it did. Reviewing a diff with no idea what was asked for is the failure mode this contract exists to prevent — never proceed as if the diff speaks for itself.

**Never use the brief to suppress real findings.** It excludes work that was deliberately not done. It does not excuse defects in the work that *was* done. Security, **privacy**, data-loss, and correctness problems inside the change are always in scope, whatever the brief says — a brief cannot exclude them, and filter 1 must not get the chance to defer them before the later filters see them. Which filter then catches one depends on its source, and both outcomes block: a violation of a written rule or invariant is a contract blocker at filter 2, while a defect you found by reading the change is ranked at filter 3, where a real one is Material. The point of this rule is that the brief cannot keep such a finding out of scope — not that every one of them is a contract blocker. If a reviewer flags something excluded and the exclusion turns out to be invalid — see § Three filters, filter 1, for the only two things that re-open scope — fix the work and correct the brief. Being *correct* is not one of them: a true observation about work the change deliberately did not do stays deferred.

## The materiality bar

**This bar applies to findings a reviewer originates from its own judgment — what survives the scope and contract filters below. Such a finding is worth reporting when acting on it would change what the artifact does, or change how a competent reader acts on it. Everything else is an observation, not a finding.**

This is not a licence to ignore problems. It is a ranking rule: report what clears the bar, and put what does not in one closing note rather than in the blocking list.

### Three filters, in this order

Materiality is the **last** of three, and applying it out of order produces the wrong verdict:

1. **Scope** — is this finding ours at all? An out-of-scope finding is deferred with the exclusion that covers it, **however material it looks in isolation**. A valid improvement to work this change deliberately did not do is still out of scope. Materiality never promotes something back into scope.

   **"The reviewer was right" does not by itself re-open scope.** An excluded observation can be perfectly true — for a docs-only change, "the implementation is absent" is *correct* and still out of scope, because its absence is the exclusion. Only two things pull an item back in: it is a defect in work this change **actually did**, or the exclusion itself was invalid (it excluded something a brief may not exclude, such as a security, privacy, data-loss or correctness problem inside the change). Anything else is deferred with the exclusion cited, no matter how accurate.
2. **Contract** — is it a violation of a project rule, security or privacy invariant, or another mandatory requirement the project wrote down? Those are **blocking by virtue of being rules**, and the bar does not filter them. The project already decided they matter; that decision is not a reviewer's to re-make per finding.
3. **Materiality** — for everything left, which is findings a reviewer originates from its own judgment: does acting on it change anything?

A finding that fails filter 1 is deferred. One that passes filter 2 is a **contract blocker** — blocking on its own terms, and never ranked by the bar. Only what reaches filter 3 is ranked below.

### Blocking — the one term everything else uses

**A finding is BLOCKING if it is any of these three:**

1. **A contract blocker** — it passed filter 2. Unranked by the bar, blocking by virtue of being a rule.
2. **Material** — see the tier table below.
3. **Substantive** — see the tier table below.

**An immaterial finding is never blocking.** Past the scope filter that is the whole vocabulary: *blocking* or *immaterial*. A finding that never got past it is *deferred* (filter 1, and § Resolver dispositions) — do not fold one of those into *immaterial*, which drops the exclusion that covers it and the follow-up record with it.

Every downstream rule is written in terms of **blocking**, deliberately. Fix blocking findings; push for blocking findings; keep going while blocking findings arrive; converge when none is left unresolved.

**This generalises, and it is the rule that keeps this document workable: every normative rule here is defined once and referenced, never restated.** That covers the blocking definition, the convergence test, the iteration bound, the two conditions that re-open scope, and the resolver dispositions below. A skill that paraphrases one of them creates a copy that goes stale the moment the original changes — and a stale copy is always the *narrower* one, so it under-blocks, under-converges, or re-opens scope it should not. Name the rule and link the section. If a skill genuinely needs different behaviour, change it here, for everyone.

**One exception, and only one: text sent verbatim to an external tool.** A prompt handed to `codex review` or any reviewer outside this repo cannot follow a link, so it MUST inline the rule. Such a block is a **mirror**: mark it as one, keep it a faithful restatement of the canonical section rather than an independent edit, and update it in the same commit that changes the canonical text. Nothing an agent reads directly qualifies — only strings crossing a process boundary.

### Resolver dispositions

Every finding handed to a resolver carries exactly one, and they are defined here so no resolver invents a fourth:

- **`blocking`** — fix it and push. See § Blocking.
- **`immaterial`** — reply with the reasoning and resolve. **No edit**: a fix push reopens the review loop for something that changes nothing.
- **`deferred`** — reply citing the exclusion that covers it and resolve. **No edit**, and never widen the change to satisfy it.

**A `blocking` disposition may arrive annotated `already fixed in <sha>`.** That is not a fourth disposition — it is the same one, with the fix already carried out, because the coordinator batched it (`head-discipline.md` § Batch findings). Treat it as reply-and-resolve: cite the commit, resolve the thread, and **make no edit and no push**. Verify the fix is in the branch before resolving; if it is not, the annotation is wrong — report that rather than resolving on it.

**A disposition assigned by the coordinator is authoritative and overrides a resolver's own categorisation.** The coordinator holds the Scope Brief and the ledger; a resolver classifying from the comment text alone does not, and its local heuristics — a `[nitpick]` prefix, a tracker-update path — must not override a disposition set with that context.

**Because it is authoritative, assign one only where there is a finding to dispose of.** A reviewer thread is not automatically a finding: one whose premise does not hold — it describes code that no longer exists, or it misreads a deliberate project convention — is a false positive, and none of the three dispositions is true of it. Verify the premise first. Where it fails, leave the thread **undisposed and say why**, so the resolver runs its own outdated/incorrect handling: those paths reply, resolve, and where the convention was misread record it in `REVIEW.md` so every reviewer stops raising it. Labelling such a thread `immaterial` to fill the field overrides that handling and loses the `REVIEW.md` entry — the one output that stops the finding coming back. An undisposed thread is filled in downstream; a wrongly disposed one is not.

### The bar

| Tier | Examples | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Material** | Wrong behaviour, data loss, security, a build/CI/test that will fail, a contradiction that makes the artifact unimplementable, a stated fact that is false **and that a reader would act on** | Report individually. **Blocking.** |
| **Substantive** | A genuine ambiguity a reader could act on two ways; a missing step that would be discovered late and cost a cycle | Report individually. **Blocking.** |
| **Immaterial** | Wording that is merely improvable; a count off by one where nothing keys on the count; formatting; a synonym that reads better | **One closing note, unnumbered, non-blocking.** Never a separate finding, never a reason for another pass. |

An entry missing from a list the artifact does not present as exhaustive is **not reported at all** — not as a finding and not in the closing note. It is the first of the three non-findings below, and it is excluded rather than demoted because the supply of such entries never runs out: a note listing them grows without bound and invites the next pass to extend it.

When unsure which tier something is, ask: *if this shipped uncorrected, what breaks?* If the honest answer is "nothing, it is just not as good as it could be", it is immaterial.

**When two rows both seem to fit, that question decides it — reader impact, not the category label.** A document that says "four steps" above five steps is both a false stated fact and a count nothing keys on; it is **immaterial**, because no reader acts on the number. The same document saying a command takes `--base` when it rejects `--base` is **material**, because a reader will run it and it will fail. The falsehood is not what makes a finding material; acting on the falsehood is.

### Three things that are not findings

**A missing entry in a list the artifact does not present as exhaustive.** If a document says "for example" or "this list is illustrative; the rule is authoritative", then supplying entry N+1 does not improve it — the rule already covers N+1. Assess whether the *rule* is correct and sufficient. Reporting further missing entries against a declared-open list is the single most common way a review loop fails to terminate, because the supply of such entries never runs out.

**A decision already made, recorded, and reasoned — where the disagreement is about preference.** Once an artifact states a decision with its rationale, including a rationale that says "we do not know, and here is how we will find out", re-arguing it is not a review finding. Say so once as a single escalation; do not re-raise it on the next pass in different words. A preference re-litigated across passes needs a person, not another round.

**But a recorded rationale does not make a decision safe.** If the decision *itself* is the defect — it leaks a credential, loses data, violates a security or privacy invariant, or contradicts a contract the project mandates — it is **blocking and stays blocking until resolved**, however carefully it is reasoned. Which kind of blocking follows the filters, and you do not need to decide it to act: where it violates a rule the project wrote down it is a contract blocker at filter 2; where it is your own reading of a defect it is Material at filter 3. Both block, so the disposition is identical. Writing down why you did an unsafe thing does not make it safe. The distinction is whether you disagree with the choice or the choice is wrong: the first is an escalation, the second is a finding.

**An artifact that admits a limit.** "This is verified by X at implementation time", "this is an open question gated on Y" — those are dispositions, not gaps. Check the gate is real and sequenced before the thing that depends on it; do not report the limit itself.

### Convergence

**A review has converged when a pass produces no unresolved blocking findings — not when it produces zero output.** Zero is usually unreachable and waiting for it burns cycles on immaterial churn.

Track findings per pass and watch the shape, not just the count:

- **Blocking findings still arriving, in new categories** — keep going. The review is still working.
- **No blocking finding left unresolved** — converged, whatever the immaterial count did. Note the test is *unresolved*, not *new*: a blocker carried from an earlier pass still blocks even if this pass did not repeat it, so the current pass's thread count is not the whole ledger. Track them and clear the list. Stop, and say so: report the trend and what remains below the bar. A pass that falls from five immaterial observations to three *different* immaterial observations has converged; the drop is churn, not progress.
- **The same disagreement in successive passes** — stop. That is a human decision, not a review outcome. Escalate it by name.

Report the trend when you stop, so the operator can see the shape rather than take "clean" on trust: *"Findings per pass: 9, 4, 1, 0 blocking. Stopping — three immaterial wording items remain, listed below."*

**A rising count is a divergence signal, not progress.** If a pass produces more blocking findings than the one before it and they are all the same class, the last round's fix is generating them. Stop and address the cause rather than the instances — then **continue the loop**, because a root fix nothing has reviewed is not convergence. Only if the cause is a design choice with two defensible answers does the loop end, as an escalation to the user.

**State honestly what the last pass did not cover.** If you stop after applying fixes that were never themselves reviewed, say so. A loop that stops at the bound below has *not* converged, and reporting it as clean is a false result.

### Fix the class, not the instance

**This is the single biggest cause of a review loop that will not end, and the bar alone does not prevent it.** A reviewer reports the instance it happened to read. If you fix exactly that instance, the next pass finds a sibling — same defect, different location — and reports it as a new finding. Every pass is then genuinely productive and the loop still never terminates, because the supply of siblings is the size of the class, not the size of the review.

The failure is invisible from inside a single pass. Each finding is real, each fix is correct, each pass costs a full cycle, and the count drifts sideways forever. Watch for the signature: **findings that are individually valid and collectively repetitive.** That is not the reviewer being pedantic; it is the previous fix having been too small.

**A finding is an instance of a class until you have proved it unique.** Before fixing, name the class — the defect *pattern*, stated without reference to any location — then find every site in this change's surface that exhibits it, and fix them together in one commit.

#### Reporting a class — the reviewer's half of the same rule

The fixer can only close a class the reviewer described as one, so this half is canonical too, and every reviewer is bound by it:

**When a finding is one instance of a pattern you can see elsewhere, say so, list every other site you found, and count the whole thing as ONE finding that names the class.** Not one finding per site, and not a single site with the rest left unsaid.

Both failure modes cost cycles, in opposite ways. A reviewer that reports one occurrence of a defect visible in eleven places has handed the author ten future review cycles — each one genuinely productive, and the loop still never ending. A reviewer that reports the same defect as eleven findings has hidden that they are one defect, so the author fixes eleven symptoms instead of the cause, and the count says the review is diverging when it is not.

Where a reviewer reports a class, the fixer's sweep above is what discharges it, and the class is not closed until every listed site is fixed.

#### The sibling axes

A class rarely lives at one altitude or in one file. Check each axis before declaring a sweep complete:

| Axis | The question | Typical miss |
|---|---|---|
| **Lexical** | Where else does this exact wording appear? | A phrase fixed at one site, unchanged at eleven others |
| **Altitude** | Does this rule also appear as a summary, a table row, a step-by-step handler, a checklist, a success criterion, an example, a template, or a command block? | The definition is corrected; the procedure that implements it still describes the old behaviour, and a reader who follows the steps gets the old rule |
| **Symmetry** | Is there a counterpart file or branch — reviewer A and reviewer B, mode 1 and mode 2, the parallel resolver? | One of a near-identical pair is fixed and the twin is untouched |
| **Enumeration** | If one member of a list was wrong, are the others? | A list gains a missing case at the site reported and keeps the same gap everywhere else it is restated |

#### Prove the sweep with a search that would fail

**A sweep is not complete because it felt complete.** End it with a search whose *empty result* is the evidence, and read that result. Two ways this has genuinely gone wrong, both of which reported success:

- **A line-oriented search against prose that wraps.** The phrase existed, split across a newline, and `grep` could not see it. Normalise whitespace before searching for anything longer than a few words.
- **A search that excluded the file under review.** A filter meant to trim noise removed the one remaining site, and the empty output was read as proof.

If the verifying search cannot fail, it is not verifying anything. State the search you ran alongside the claim that the class is closed, so a wrong one is visible rather than trusted.

#### When the class is large, the duplication is the defect

Past a handful of sites, stop syncing copies and remove the need for them: define the rule once and have every other site reference it (§ Blocking is the worked example). Fixing eleven copies leaves eleven copies to drift again on the next change. This is a design decision, so if it is not obviously right, raise it rather than performing a large mechanical rewrite unasked.

#### Scope still binds

Sweeping a class is **not** a licence to widen the change. **The class is bounded by the Scope Brief's interpreted scope** — and for a request that did not ask to reach further, that is this change's blast radius: the files it touches, plus files it made inconsistent (`regression-caused-by-change`).

Do not read the bound as "the files already edited", which would be circular: when the request is itself class-wide — "make every reviewer skill do X" — a file this change has not touched *yet* is inside the brief, so it is inside the class, and deferring it leaves the requested work unfinished. The touched-file set describes where a class usually lives; the brief decides where it may go.

A sibling outside the brief is a deferred follow-up, reported and not fixed — the sprawl stop rule governs here exactly as elsewhere.

#### Close the class before re-running

**Do not start the next review pass with a class half-closed.** A re-run against a partial fix spends a full cycle to be told about the siblings you already knew about, and its findings are indistinguishable from new ones. Finish the sweep, verify it, and record the class as closed — then carry that into the next pass's prompt so the reviewer spends the pass on ground nobody has covered.

### The iteration bound

**Convergence is the goal. The bound is a runaway backstop, not a target, and reaching it is a failure to converge — never a stopping condition you are entitled to treat as success.**

**Every review-convergence loop caps at 15 iterations, and the initial pass is iteration 1.** That is the single number; skills MUST NOT set their own, and none may count the bound from *after* the first pass — that quietly buys a sixteenth. It is deliberately far above what a healthy loop needs — a review that is working converges in single digits — so that hitting it means something is wrong rather than that the work was merely large.

A loop should almost always end on one of the three signals above, all of which fire long before 15:

- **Converged** — no blocking finding left unresolved, per § Convergence above. The only successful exit. Note that is the *ledger* test, not a property of the latest pass: a quiet pass with a carried blocker still open is not convergence.
- **The same disagreement in successive passes** — the trigger defined in § Convergence above, not a looser one. Escalate by name, and do not spend the remaining iterations re-arguing it.
- **A rising count of one class** — the last fix is generating them. This is **not an exit**: fix the cause and carry on, so the fix is itself reviewed. It ends the loop only when the cause is a design choice with two defensible answers, which is an escalation to the user.

Those exits are what keep the loop short; the bound only catches a loop none of them caught. **Do not treat the headroom as licence to keep going** — an iteration that fixes only immaterial items is churn whether it is the 3rd or the 13th, and the convergence rule already forbids it.

When you stop at the bound, say so explicitly, report the per-pass trend, name what is still unresolved, and hand it to the user. "Reached 15 iterations" is an escalation, not a pass.

**Cost is real and worth stating.** A single reviewer pass on a substantial branch can take ten minutes or more, so an unattended loop that actually runs to 15 can consume hours. That is the intended trade — correctness over speed — but it is a reason to fix causes rather than instances, not a budget to spend.

## The sprawl stop rule

**When work outgrows the request, stop and tell the user.** Do not silently deliver more than was asked.

### When to stop

Stop when, mid-task, you find the request needs materially more than its own framing implies:

- Subsystems the user never named must change
- A migration, dependency, or breaking change is required
- The work needs several PRs where one was implied
- An architectural decision the user has not made is now unavoidable
- A `narrow` request turns out to need `open-ended` work

### How to stop

Report in two or three sentences: what you found, why it exceeds the request, and the cheapest path forward. Offer the narrow option first. Then wait.

> The typo is in generated output — fixing it properly means regenerating six files and updating the generator's snapshot tests. I can patch just the one visible string instead. Which do you want?

Do **not** stop with nothing done. Deliver everything that is unambiguously in scope, then raise the boundary question about the remainder.

### Calibration — do NOT stop for these

Over-triggering is its own failure. The rule covers work **outside** the request's natural boundary, not work **inside** it:

- Tests for code you just wrote — always in scope
- Docs the change invalidates — in scope
- Fixing a build or test you broke — in scope
- Following an approved spec or change document to completion — in scope, however long it takes
- Reviewer findings classified `required-by-contract` or `regression-caused-by-change` — in scope
- Ordinary multi-step work that a `normal` request plainly implies

**Autonomous long-running skills** (`team`, `workflow-runner`) exist to run unattended for extended periods. For them the trigger is **only** work outside the approved spec, change document, or task list — never mere duration, task count, or effort. A coordinator working through an approved backlog does not stop to ask permission for the next approved task; it stops when a task requires something the contract does not cover.

### Size signal changes the threshold, not the rule

| Size signal | Stop when |
|-------------|-----------|
| `narrow` | The work exceeds the request's literal framing at all. "Just do X real quick" means X, not X and its neighbours. Bias strongly toward stopping. |
| `normal` | The work needs a decision the user has not made, or reaches beyond the named subsystem. |
| `open-ended` | Only for genuine architectural forks or irreversible actions. The user has already authorized depth. |

A `narrow` request carries real weight. "Real quick" is not filler — it is a budget. Honour it, and when you cannot, say so instead of spending it anyway.
