# wait-for-ci-checks.sh
# Polls a PR for CI check completion.
#
# Usage: ./wait-for-ci-checks.sh <PR_NUMBER> [TIMEOUT_SECONDS]
# Default timeout: 900 seconds (15 minutes).
#
# ⛔ RUN THIS IN THE BACKGROUND (`run_in_background: true`), redirecting stdout and
#    stderr to a log file. The Bash tool caps a FOREGROUND `timeout` at 600 000 ms,
#    which is BELOW this script's budget — a foreground call is guaranteed to be
#    killed mid-poll, printing no STATUS and no exit code. Backgrounded processes
#    are not subject to that cap.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# STATUS PROTOCOL (shared by every wait script in this catalog)
#
# The LAST line of stdout is always `STATUS=<state>`, and the exit code mirrors it.
# Read the STATUS line; it is the primary signal.
#
#   STATUS=TERMINAL_PASS   exit 0  Every check completed and none failed.
#   STATUS=TERMINAL_FAIL   exit 1  Every check completed and at least one failed.
#                                  Settled — fix the failures, do not re-run to get
#                                  a different answer.
#   STATUS=PENDING         exit 2  Checks still running when the budget expired. NOT
#                                  a verdict and NOT a failure. Re-running is safe.
#   STATUS=NOT_CONFIGURED  exit 3  No checks appeared within the discovery grace
#                                  period — this PR has no CI configured to run on
#                                  it. TERMINAL; do not wait out the full budget.
#                                  ⚠️ This is NOT a pass. A merge gate requiring
#                                  green CI is NOT satisfied by the absence of CI.
#   STATUS=ERROR           exit 4  Bad arguments, `gh` too old or unauthenticated,
#                                  or the checks API could not be read. The wait
#                                  never started, or its reads cannot be trusted.
#
# The distinction between PENDING and TERMINAL_FAIL is the point of this protocol.
# Conflating them is what previously forced callers into blind re-run loops.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#
# BUDGET GUARANTEE: every API call is wrapped by `timeout`. Reads taken while
# WAITING are capped by the budget REMAINING, so none can outlive the deadline.
# Reads taken AFTER a verdict is decided (reporting, not waiting) are capped by
# DIAGNOSTIC_BUDGET, so STATUS can land up to that many seconds past TIMEOUT —
# a bounded, deliberate tail rather than an open-ended one.
#
# Additional machine-readable lines emitted before STATUS:
#   CHECKS_TOTAL=<n>  CHECKS_PASSED=<n>  CHECKS_FAILED=<n>  CHECKS_SKIPPED=<n>
#   PR_HEAD_SHA=<sha|unknown>   on every TERMINAL verdict — TERMINAL_PASS,
#                               TERMINAL_FAIL, and NOT_CONFIGURED alike. PENDING
#                               and ERROR are not verdicts, so they carry none.
#
# PR_HEAD_SHA IS PART OF THE VERDICT, NOT DECORATION. A CI result is evidence about
# exactly one commit. `gh pr checks` always reports the PR's CURRENT head, so a push
# landing mid-wait silently moves what is being observed — the caller launched this
# on SHA A and can be handed a verdict about SHA B. The head is therefore read on
# BOTH sides of the checks read the verdict came from, and a SHA is printed only
# when the two agree; the caller compares it against the SHA it recorded and
# discards a superseded result.
#
# `unknown` means the pair could not be confirmed — either read failed, or the head
# moved while the verdict was being read. The verdict still stands for whatever the
# head was at the time, but it cannot be attributed here, so the caller MUST confirm
# the SHA itself before treating it as merge evidence. See
# dev/references/head-discipline.md § Evidence is SHA-scoped.

# shell start, so a reset placed later left the preflight calls outside the budget

# than the whole budget allowed before it even began waiting. One clock, started
# before the first network byte, bounds the entire run.

# ─── Budget enforcement for API calls ────────────────────────────────────────
# Deadline CHECKS only stop the next poll from STARTING; they do nothing about a
# request already in flight. A hung `gh` call started one second before the
# deadline delays STATUS indefinitely, which defeats the whole point of an
# advertised wall-clock bound. So every API call is wrapped by one of two caps:
#
#   wait_cap  — for reads taken while WAITING. Capped by the budget REMAINING, so
#               no read can outlive the deadline.
#   DIAGNOSTIC_BUDGET — for reads taken AFTER a verdict is already decided (that
#               is, reporting, not waiting). STATUS can therefore land up to this
#               many seconds past TIMEOUT; that tail is bounded and deliberate.
#
# ⚠️ `timeout 0 CMD` DISABLES the timeout in coreutils — it does not expire
# immediately. A zero cap must therefore SKIP the call, never pass 0 to `timeout`.
# Callers check `budget_exhausted` before any waiting read.
